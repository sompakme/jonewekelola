Everywhere, with the exception of the United States With this manufacturing, it indicates that this great “American” firm is transferring American employment to a foreign country.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>In light of this, where do Carter’s outfits get their design inspirations from?</h3><p>A lengthy journey had been undertaken to reach this location from the company’s headquarters in the Georgian metropolis of Atlanta. In any case, Carter’s has had a presence in China for more than two decades. The majority of Casey’s items are obtained locally, with the exception of infant gear, which is made in China, he said.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-147 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>Do you know whether Carters employs children?</h3><p>&nbsp;United States Cotton — Due to the widespread and government-sanctioned use of forced child labour in the cotton harvesting industry in Uzbekistan, we do not allow any cotton from that country to be used in our goods. Slavery and human trafficking are completely prohibited in our product supply chain, and Carter’s enforces this policy.</p><p></p><h3>Also, one can wonder, who is the owner of the Carters apparel company?</h3><p>A significant American designer and marketer of children’s wear, Carter’s, Inc. is based in the city of Atlanta. Founder William Carter established the company in 1865. Retail locations such as Carter’s and OshKosh B’gosh shops, the company’s website, and other retail channels such as department stores are where Carter’s sells its merchandise.</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>How reliable is the Carters brand?</h3><p>There are a total of 25 responses.
