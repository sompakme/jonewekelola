Kim Kardashian claims her pearl gown was “less stressful” than the iconic moment she wore the famous Marilyn Monroe JFK birthday dress. However, Kim’s daughter North West was less than impressed and called the look “beachy”.</strong></p><p>She pled with her daughter <a href=#>North West</a>, 10, to “go easy on her” when being styled for the Met Gala. Spray tan-ready, <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> wore a Schiaparelli pearl dress to the prestigious event. The original plan was to bring Karl Lagerfeld’s cat with her, but North reckons the pet would have ruined her mom’s outfit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2023/11/GettyImages-1488061801-683x1024.jpg><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kim-k-s-pearl-dress-at-the-met-gala>Kim K’s pearl dress at the Met Gala</h2><p>Kim K’s pearl dress at the Met Gala featured a whopping 50,000&nbsp;pearls and over 16,000 crystals on the Schiaparelli Chain&nbsp;Dress. The ensemble took over 1,000 hours to make!</p><p>The pearl gown worn by Kim Kardashian featured a pearl draped skirt and top, along with a molded corset in blush satin. Over the top, she wore a bone whitewashed&nbsp;faille stole.</p><p>Kim accessorized with a shimmering choker, pearl drop earrings and an articulated ring, made out of baroque pearls and crystals. Some pearls fell off on the way to the event, but North collected them!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-pearl-gown-described-as-cheap-by-north>Pearl gown described as ‘cheap’ by North</h2><p>North West said that the pearls on Kim Kardashian’s gown look “cheap” but the Hulu star claimed they are “very expensive, real pearls” that her daughter “needs a lesson on.”</p><p>She had seen the dress during a fitting via FaceTime. The then-nine-year-old said she “loved” the look. “This was the first time North said, ‘Oh wow, that’s beautiful,'”, Kim told designer Daniel Roseberry.</p><p>“I like the pearls. I just don’t like that it comes from the dollar store,” she said at one point in the conversation. She thought the dress made her mom look like a “Hawaiian girl with her dress all ripped.”</p><p>“It’s looking, like, beachy,” North said. Roseberry said he was watching his “worst nightmare” unfold. “It’s like I’m being punked,” he said. “The night before the Met, getting read for filth by a nine-year-old.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>North telling Kim her Met Gala dress looks cheap 🫠 <a href=#>#TheKardashians</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BpTQkxnenp</a></p>— bravoandy (@bravoandyalt) <a href=#>November 23, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-north-is-kim-s-biggest-critic>North is Kim’s ‘biggest critic’</h2><p>North also said there were “way too (many) gaps in the pearls” in the outfit, and that the “diamonds ruined it.”&nbsp;Kim said: “We’re not going for, like, flapper girl, we’re going for vintage, authentic, pearly girly.”</p><p>Kim also warned Roseberry: “Okay, Daniel, I’m just warning you, North can be critical. I mean, I had John Galliano fitting me for a dress, and North was giving notes. I mean, this is just her vibe.”</p><p>Fashionista North joined Kim for the car ride to the gala, wearing her own pearl pink tweed jacket and a conch shell clutch. She later said her mom “looks gorgeous” and called the look her “favorite”.</p><p>She tuned into the red carpet viewings from the comfort of a hotel room, where Kim joined her to eat pizza instead of going to the Met Gala after-party. She said she was “glad” so she could be with her kids.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>North did not just tell the creative director of Schiaparelli that the met dress he designed for Kim looks like it’s from the dollar store 😭😭😭 TO HIS FACE 😭 she’s a savage and an icon! <a href=#>#TheKardashians</a></p>— j e s s i c a❣ (@jessicaminto666) <a href=#>November 23, 2023</a></figure>View Tweet<p class=has-text-align-center>WATCH THE KARDASHIANS ON HULU AND DISNEY PLUS EVERY THURSDAY</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqLWww9JooqKlXaDAbrzEmqmlZZSnsrS%2FjKWmqKOjYq%2BmrcKhsGaZo2K7sL7ToWSwnaOpeqS%2ByK2gqq2VqHqpsdFmpKilo2K6psCMoJilmV2hvLC3</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
