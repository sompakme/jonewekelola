There’s the one present in the classroom where teachers are just trying to get through a lesson. And then there’s the outside perspective of us engaging with teachers through the news.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Brunson compared her thought process on this topic to her approach to race on the comedy, in which she says she “really wanted to lead with everyday story first, and let everything fold into that.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I wanted to talk about, instead of ‘Janine confronts her Blackness,’ or ‘Janine deals with this race issue,’ it’s really just like, ‘Janine is trying to change a light bulb.’ I think that’s the way the majority of the people that I [know are],” she told the magazine. “When they’re at work, the issue at work is just the task at hand.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Speaking directly to the challenges around situating a school shooting episode within the Abbott Elementary universe, the writer and actress says that while for audiences “these school shootings are the biggest thing happening,” talking to her friends who are currently working as teachers has shown that “yes, that’s huge, but today they’re just trying to get through this lesson.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They’re just trying to get the reading scores up. They’re just trying to do this job,” she continued. “If anything, the school shooting thing is in the background, like, ‘Fuck.’ It’s kind of like, ‘We got to deal with that too?'”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Brunson admits that it’s ultimately “complicated” and that she isn’t sure she wants to dedicate the space she has with the hit comedy to what tackling that topic could do within the larger culture.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I don’t want to open up my show to that political violence,” she explained. “I consider it that at this point — even the discourse of it is violent. And although I participate in it outside of my show, and I’m a huge advocate for eradicating gun violence in this country … I don’t think my show has to carry that.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Brunson previously spoke</a> about why she wouldn’t cover the issue on X, formerly known as Twitter, last year after fans tweeted and direct messaged her about it following a then-recent school shooting in Texas. At the time, the Abbott Elementary creator shared that gun violence had affected her family personally, but suggested viewers focus on getting their elected officials to prioritize addressing the issue through legislation versus asking TV shows to highlight the troubling reality in their narratives.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“[P]eople are that deeply removed from demanding more from the politicians they’ve elected and are instead demanding ‘entertainment,'” she wrote. “Gun violence is a constant, day after day problem. Mass shootings are only part of it. Stop saying nothing can be done. … If you vote, demand more from the people you elected to change laws.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOqqyipqSWeqO%2B1KeqqKZdlq%2BwwNNmnKWdnZq7ta3RsmSsm5ikvK150qGmqKyZo7Rusc%2BiqqiclWJ%2Bc3%2BUb2ptbGVsfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
