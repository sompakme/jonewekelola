He's starring in a massively popular series, has been linked to his co-star Keeley Hazell and he's also <a href=#>a proud father to his two children, Otis and Daisy</a>. However, there's also a rare medical condition that he lives with and it's one that a lot of people don't know about. Sudeikis can't smell or taste anything and no, it has nothing to do with COVID-19. Instead, he has a condition called <a href=#>anosmia</a>.&nbsp;His ex, Olivia Wilde, talked about it during an interview with People back in 2015. She said, "I just made risotto like 10 minutes ago. I like to cook, but I also have the easiest audience in the world. My fiance [Jason Sudeikis] has no sense of smell — he was born without it — so he thinks everything I cook tastes amazing! It really builds my confidence."</p><p>Even with Wilde's cooking skills (or lack thereof), Sudeikis still has a lot of preferences when it comes to the food he likes to eat, despite not being able to smell or taste much.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcW9paIRxe9OhnGaqkaeybrnEnaCcmZxisLC6w6KroqeeYreiv86nZKytlJq2rLXSZqOirpWoeri106Fm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
