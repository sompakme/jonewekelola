New allegations have come out as part of the #SpeakingOut movement that are very concerning.</p><p>Wiggy posted an anonymous account of a friend’s experiences at Chikara and the company’s wrestling school. This new account from Chikara adds to the previous allegation about <a href=#>Icarus and his proclivity for leaving bruises on an underage girl.</a></p><p>The accusation alleges that Quackenbush made “numerous misogynistic, racist, and homophobic remarks.” He would also laugh while telling trainees about a former trainee who came out to him as gay in confidence. He developed a mean nicknamed “Probably Gay [redacted]” that he called this trainee behind his back.</p><p>It was also alleged that Mike Quackenbush was in an apparent relationship with a female trainee, and he used his influence to get her. He would also provide her with special treatment such as a hotel room to herself when other trainees were “crammed” into one room.</p><p>Quackenbush also allegedly pointed out an attractive female fan in the crowd and asked his roster who has seen her private area. This encouraged a wrestler to target that fan who Quackenbush called attention to.</p><p>There are other allegations such as abusive language. A wrestler with autism was allegedly called a “f*cking retard” in front of everyone. Quackenbush made homophobic jokes, and it was said that anyone who speaks out against him is immediately “banished.”</p><p>Keep checking back with <a href=#>Ringside News</a> for more on this on-going situation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class=wp-block-image></figure><figure class=wp-block-image></figure><figure class=wp-block-image></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>Felix Upton</span> <span></span><p>Felix Upton is a seasoned writer with over 30 years of experience.
