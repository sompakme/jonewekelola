Christmas happens to fall on a Monday this year, and WWE isn’t going to make their talent and staff make that trip for the Holidays.</p><p><a href=#>The legend is that Vince McMahon doesn’t care abotu Christmas</a>, but WWE is still going to do something special this year. That being said, this may not have been Mr. McMahon’s call.</p><p>WWE Superstars don’t get a ton of time at home, but it appears that they will get that opportunity on Christmas this year. <a href=#>This may be different from previous years</a>, but the company is also in a new era after the TKO merger.</p><p><a href=#>The Wrestling Observer Newsletter </a>noted that WWE is not going to run a live RAW episode on Christmas Day this year. That will likely be a best-of episode instead.</p><p>The biggest house show week of the year, the week after Christmas, had the schedule announced. The Monday is 12/25 and they are not running a show that day, so Raw will either be a Best of show or they will tape two episodes of Raw on 12/18 or do a taping on 12/19. It’s almost impossible to tape two episodes in one night because of the length of Raw. There will be the annual 12/26 show in Madison Square Garden. They also run 12/26 in Baltimore. 12/27 has shows in Boston and Detroit. 12/28 is Montreal and Houston. 12/29 will be a Smackdown taping in Toronto and a Raw brand house show in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. They are also running 12/30 at the Forum in Los Angeles. There will be a 1/1 live Raw from San Diego</p><p>We will have to see what WWE produces for their Christmas Day episode of RAW. Odds are, fans will tune in to see what the company has in store for them, because the night of Christmas is usually filled with television options, and WWE RAW will be a part of the mix.</p><p>WWE has a lot of options for the next year, but it appears that they are going to give their roster a little break for Christmas. This move will probably be appreciated throughout the company, but the show must go on, even if it’s a best-of episode.</p><p>Do you think that WWE is making the right call by airing an alternative episode on Christmas? Will you watch it anyway?
