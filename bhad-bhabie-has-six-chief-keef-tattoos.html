Moreover, she recently appeared on the High Low with EmRata podcast with Emily Ratajkowski on Tuesday (April 25). Not only did Bhabie go into her experience a bit, but she also revealed that she has six Sosa-inspired tattoos at the moment. Of course, <a href=# rel>this isn't the first time</a> that the teen star-turned-rapper spoke on their relationship, even if she didn't explicitly label it back then. Still, it seems things changed a lot since then, because she mentioned wanting to remove the ink one day.</p><p>"I have one guy&nbsp;that managed to make it six times, five or six," Bhad Bhabie told Ratajkowski when asked about having all her exes as <a href=# rel>body art</a>. "So, I have&nbsp;Chief Keefâ€™s birthday, his last name, his name, his nickname, and I have 'CK' on my ankle, then I have his last name right here. Actually, I just covered his birthday, and then I have 'So' on my ear, and then I have 'Keef' on my wrist." However, the Florida native said that she's "sick of his s**t," which is why she covered his birthday.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bhad-bhabie-wants-to-remove-her-six-chief-keef-tattoos>Bhad Bhabie Wants To Remove Her Six Chief Keef Tattoos</h2></span><p>"I'm getting them removed, I'm just tired of being delusional. I'm so over it," she continued. Later, the <a href=# rel>20-year-old </a>reflected on a conversation with a friend, who told her things will be better one day. "It's been a long run,"&nbsp;she said before confirming that they were done. "But I would say we were pretty close. But it was like, I don't know, I've known him for a minute." Elsewhere in the conversation, she expressed regret and revealed that she was 18 when they started seeing each other.</p><p>Despite the bad blood, the "Hi Bich" rapper maintained that felt very close with Sosa. Unfortunately, it seems like their fling was unfruitful at the end of the day. Regardless of any issues they might have had, at least Bhabie looks ready to <a href=# rel>move on</a> at this point.
