In the time since the catchy potential song of the summer landed on DSPs, we've also seen Caresha step out with Sean Combs to sit courtside for an NBA game. At the time their famous faces were seen on the jumbotron, aptly naming them <a href=# rel>"Mr. & Mrs. 'Act Bad'."</a></p><p>They were dripping in designer duds while at the game, but in her free time, Miami is making it clear what her vibes are for the coming months. From the looks of things, the rap diva will be spending plenty of time outside, showing off her bodacious body. Her Twitter profile has already been lighting up with videos of her throwing it back in the club at 3 AM and salacious, <a href=# rel>flirtatious messages</a> to Moneybagg Yo's partner Ari Fletcher. On Monday (May 29), she turned up the heat some more, sharing a clip of her saucily strutting through what looks to be a luxurious hotel pool area.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Moneybagg Yo Tweets & Deletes Thirsty Response To Ari Fletcher & Yung Miami's Flirting</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-yung-miami-reminds-us-how-to-act-bad>Yung Miami Reminds Us How to "Act Bad"</h2></span><p>The mother of two wore nothing more than an ultra-tiny black one-piece swimsuit, the words "Act Bad" written across her chest. While Caresha's front is fully under wraps, nearly her entire backside is on display in the thong-cut garment. "God d*mn! Miami said, 'That's a motherf*cking thong, b*tch!'" a friend recording behind the camera yells out. The City Girl nonchalantly walks past two people while showing off her goods, both of whom awkwardly stroll away as she proudly lets her star power shine.</p><p>It remains unclear what else Caresha, Diddy, and their other collaborators have in store to promote their new single, but knowing them, it definitely won't be lowkey. Would you be brave enough to wear Yung Miami's "Act Bad" swimsuit in public?
