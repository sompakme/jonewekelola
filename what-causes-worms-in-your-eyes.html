People infected by the parasite typically don't suffer that fate, because, like Beckley, they can remove the worms from their eyes.<h2>Can worms cause blindness in humans?</h2>Onchocerciasis, commonly known as “river blindness”, is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. Symptoms include severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions, and visual impairment, including permanent blindness. More than 99% of infected people live in 31 African countries.<h2>How can I naturally get rid of eye floaters?</h2><p>How to reduce eye floaters naturally</p><li>Hyaluronic acid.

The vitreous humour in your eyes is made of 98% of water. If you're constantly dehydrated, this gel-like substance can lose shape or shrink. This can lead to the occurrence of floaters because the proteins in this substance do not remain dissolved and thus, they solidify.<h2>Why do I sometimes see tiny moving dots?</h2>Eye floaters (known as floaters) are tiny specks that can be seen in your field of vision – especially when you look at a light-coloured area (such as a blue sky or white wall). They are created when tiny clumps form in the clear, jelly-like substance (the vitreous humour) inside the eyeball.<h2>Can eye floaters be cured?</h2>There are no safe and proven methods to cure the symptom of eye floaters caused by vitreous syneresis or posterior vitreous detachment.
