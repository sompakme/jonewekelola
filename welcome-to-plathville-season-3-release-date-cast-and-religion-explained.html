While it's obvious from watching the show that the Plaths are super conservative Christians, <a href=#>Distractify</a> reports that the family seems to be Christian Fundamentalists. This means that they interpret the Bible very literally and restrict what they feel are temptations of the outside world.</p><p dir=ltr>More specifically, it appears the Plaths are Baptists since they've taken photos in front of some Baptist churches. However on the show, the family is shown attending smaller home churches since Kim and Barry Plath have issues with how bigger churches are run. The Plaths also homeschool their children so they can make their faith a priority, and they share their religion by performing in a Southern Gospel band.</p><p dir=ltr>Of course, <a href=#>not everyone agrees with how the Plaths</a>&nbsp;practice their religion, especially Ethan's wife, Olivia. In the <a href=#>series premiere</a>, she revealed, "When Ethan and I first got married, I was really shocked at, like, the differences in how we grew up." She also made it clear that she doesn't want to live her life that way, saying: "Obviously, we're our own family, and we're going to do things the way we choose to do them."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5gZ4B3e9aeo5ynnZp6tbuMqaOarJirtq24xGaqnpmjpLtuf4yrnKWdkaiybrDArZxmm5GowW6tzZ1kq52cnrSqu81mnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
