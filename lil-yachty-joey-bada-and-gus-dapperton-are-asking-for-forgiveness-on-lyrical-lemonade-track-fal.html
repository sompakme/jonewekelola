So many of the mainstream artists held back from dropping last year for whatever reason. Now, the stars are feeding us good already and we are not even a month in. Lyrical Lemonade, a music video company, now becoming a label of sorts. Headed by Cole Bennett, he is looking to join the rest of the big rappers dropping albums, by curating one of his own.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-fallout-by-lil-yachty-joey-bada-gus-dapperton-and-lyrical-lemonade>Listen To "Fallout" By Lil Yachty, Joey Bada$$, Gus Dapperton, And Lyrical Lemonade</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Their track is called "Fallout" and its main theme is trying to win back someone you felt you did wrong. Specifically, a romantic partner. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">This style</a> fits right in with the three names attached to this project. Joey has plenty of love songs in his catalog. Production-wise, it matches what Yachty was working with on his experimental full-length Let's Start Here. You can stream the song above with the music video link.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your initial thoughts on this brand-new single, "Fallout," by Lyrical Lemonade, Lil Yachty, Joey Bada$$, and Gus Dapperton?
