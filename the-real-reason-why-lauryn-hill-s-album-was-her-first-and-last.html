However, all that glitters is not gold. In a <a href=#>rare interview</a> with <a href=#>Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums podcast</a> in early January 2021, the Sister Act II star addressed the enigmatic question of why she never followed up her landmark album with a second studio release.</p><p dir=ltr>"I challenged the norm and introduced a new standard. I believe The Miseducation did that and I believe I still do this â€” defy convention when the convention is questionable. ... I sacrificed the quality of my life to help people experience something that had been unreachable before then," Hill said. "When I saw people struggle to appreciate what that took, I had to pull back and make sure I and my family were safe and good. I'm still doing that."</p><p dir=ltr>Believe it or not, Hill claims she was never given the opportunity to work on a second album due to racism and artist suppression in the music industry. "The wild thing is, no one from my label has ever called me and asked, 'How can we help you make another album?'" she said. "Ever ... ever. Did I say ever? Ever."</p><p dir=ltr>Fortunately, fans can count on the singer performing remixed renditions of her greatest hits at live shows. Considering how timeless Hill's album is, we doubt we will ever grow weary of her music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGhoaoF4e9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2stbp5y5qsq7GeYrWquMusZJqkkqq6bsPArGShnaJis6q%2B0q1kmqaUYrmiv9No</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
