Soon enough, Bromstad landed a spot on the first-ever season of "Design Star," and well, of course, he won, per <a href=#>HGTV</a>. How much did he end up taking home? A cool $250,000.</p><p dir=ltr>Sure, the prize winnings were nice and helped him invest and start his design firm, but the real value came from the name recognition.
