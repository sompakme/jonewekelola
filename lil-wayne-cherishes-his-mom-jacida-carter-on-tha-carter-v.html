The message goes a little something like this:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Lil Wayne, mama proud of you. You done came so far. I can't wait for your album to come out," she says.&nbsp;"A lot of people ask me when it's coming out. They can't wait for your album to come out. I'm just proud of you. You's my rock [...]&nbsp;I just pray things go well with you in life. But I thank the lord, because I know you have been through a lot that I don't even know about. Mama love you. I love you Dwayne, with all my heart. You is my life I live for you."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Her next overture is at the tail end of "Open Letter," which serves as a reconciliatory&nbsp;message to the interconnected pathways of Weezy's support system, of which Jacida&nbsp;Carter is the central unit. The recording encompasses words of encouragement Weezy received from his mother follwing&nbsp;news of his teenage pregnancy with "Toya" Wright, mother to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Reginae</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"You know when he told me that Toya was having a baby, I said, 'Y'all young. Y'all young,&nbsp;but be the best father you can be," she is recorded saying. "And, truly, he is that."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Again, her voice is heard on&nbsp;"Hittas" where she lauds her child's precocious talents.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"He's a very a smart&nbsp;child. And I just say he was a genius, you know what I'm sayin? Which I used to pray—I asked the lord to send me one. And he did. He's so smart, I can't teach him nothing. He done been there before."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In "Used 2," Jacida&nbsp;recapitulates a scary moment when Weezy shot himself (with a gun) as a child. The scary incident left a mark on her years to come.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I still don't know today. Was he playing with the gun or was it an accident I still&nbsp;... I just don't&nbsp;I ... I be wanting to ask him but I never asked him out&nbsp;all these years. Was that a accident or did he... or was he playing with the gun? So I never really found out about what—you know, what happ- what really happened with him and that shooting."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Jacida's&nbsp;involvement one the project is but one reason why Tha Carter V is deeply evocative on a personal level, like nothing before it on Weezy's record. Like any "support system" with the good sense to help an ailing family member, Jacida&nbsp;has been the bedrock behind Lil Wayne's shaky foundation for X amount of years, it's now more clear than ever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdha4ZzhJNmo6KkXayuurrEZpqhnaKewKmx0mafoqtdoryuecmamqKckWKwor7Tnqlmp55iwamtjJyYq6yVp3q3ec2erqw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
