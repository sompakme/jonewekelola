On the other hand, a lot of them — like <a href=# rel=nofollow>this one</a>&nbsp;— look like a fourteen-year-old girl with emo bangs and a Tumblr account attacked them with a few of her favorite Photoshop filters.”</p><p>Cohen also wants to see more “pithy statements” and suggest Franco take a page from Kanye West’s book when it comes to Twitter. (West’s tweets have included “I just threw some kazoo on this bitch.”)</p><p>On Tuesday, Franco tweeted out a <a href=# rel=nofollow>picture</a> of himself overlaid with the words “F— THE YALE DAILY NEWS” in red capital letters.</p><p>Cohen’s response? In a new <a href=# rel=nofollow>post</a> Wednesday, the writer expressed surprise and some doubt that Franco even read the original post, much less took the time out to respond directly to it. But in the event that Franco was targeting Cohen, it’s “also possibly the pinnacle of my career as a writer.”</p><p>Cohen concludes by writing that Franco “ranted in the form of a random picture. #wellplayedsir. … I’m becoming convinced that James Franco’s whole life is a form of postmodern performance art. In that context, his Twitter fits right in.”</p><p>Franco received a slew of negative reviews regarding his performance as co-host of Sunday’s <a href=#>Oscars</a> alongside <strong><a href=# id=auto-tag_anne-hathaway data-tag=anne-hathaway>Anne Hathaway</a>.</strong></p><p>“In what could go down as one of the worst Oscar telecasts in history, a bad and risky idea — letting two actors host — proved out in spectacularly unwatchable fashion on the biggest of all nights for the film world,” The Hollywood Reporter’s Tim Goodman <a href=#>wrote</a>. “Despite an overall rewarding of brilliant performances and no truly shocking didn’t-see-that-coming upsets, the 83rd Annual Academy Awards will likely be remembered as the night&nbsp;James Franco&nbsp;couldn’t act like a host.”</p><p>But Franco, who was up for best actor for his role in <strong>Danny Boyle’s</strong> 127 Hours, has remained silent about all the criticism on Twitter or anywhere else.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKK6xquwZqKRorK0ecWrmKebn2LAtr7Fmpqeq12pxKrA056pZmlmaIFxfY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
