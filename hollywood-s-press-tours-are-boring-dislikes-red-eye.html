He also pointed to his film’s success — alongside Barbie, both films’ Barbenheimer trend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">set records at the box office last summer</a> — as evidence that the press wouldn’t even have been necessary after all.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Same was the case with<a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/peaky-blinders-cillian-murphy-season-5-his-melancholic-gangster-1245431/ rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Peaky Blinders</a>,” Murphy continued of the show in which he played protagonist Thomas “Tommy” Shelby for the duration of the show’s six seasons.&nbsp;“The first three seasons there was no advertising, a tiny show on BBC Two; it just caught fire because people talked to each other about it.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“It’s like Joanne Woodward said,” he added. “‘Acting is like sex — do it, don’t talk about it.’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Murphy clarified that it’s not the premise of press that he dislikes, but the surface-level monotony it has become. “People always used to say to me, ‘He has reservations,’ or ‘He’s a difficult interviewee.’ Not really,” he said. “I love talking about work, about art. What I struggle with — and find unnecessary — and unhelpful about what I want to do, is: ‘Tell me about yourself…’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On a related note, he also explained why he won’t take photos with fans on the street anymore. “Once I started [saying no],” he said, “it changed my life. I just think it’s better to say hello and have a little conversation. I tell that to a lot of people, you know, actor friends of mine, and they’re just like:&nbsp;I feel so bad.&nbsp;But you don’t need a photo record of everywhere you’ve been in a day.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Murphy added that he’s not a big fan of watching himself. “Many of my films I haven’t seen,” he said. “I know that Johnny Depp would always say that, but it’s actually true. Generally, the ones I haven’t seen are the ones I hear are not good.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">One of the films he hasn’t seen is Red Eye. Murphy played a terrorist who traps a hotel manager (Rachel McAdams) in an assassination plot while aboard a red eye flight to Miami in the 2005 project. “I love Rachel McAdams, and we had fun making it,” Murphy said. “But I don’t think it’s a good movie. It’s a good, B movie.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Nevertheless, Murphy is beloved by the ongoing fanbase of the film. “It’s crazy!” he said. “I think it’s the duality of it. It’s why I wanted to play it. That&nbsp;two&nbsp;thing. The nice guy and the bad guy in one. The only reason it appealed to me is you could do that…that turn, you know?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“They say the nicest people sometimes make the best villains,” McAdams told GQ of Murphy’s performance.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This isn’t the first time he’s shared his thoughts on the film. In 2021, the actor told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Uproxx</a> he thought the movie was “schlocky” but still made sure to praise McAdams.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Rachel McAdams is excellent in it, but I didn’t think I gave a very nuanced performance in it,” he said. “But, listen, if people love the movie then that’s great.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKS1y6WgmqZdosKzvMeyZKGnnKHGuLvOnWSpqpWowG6uzqugp59dp7KlecSynGZpYmiCeX6TaWpwZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
