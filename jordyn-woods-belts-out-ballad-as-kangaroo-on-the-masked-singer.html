She managed to pick herself up and pull herself together, much with the help of her loved ones and another famous family: The Smiths (Will, Jada, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Willow</a>, and Jaden).</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Jordyn Woods has been jet-setting around the world, booking modeling gigs, making television appearances, snagging movie roles,<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color"> and landing sponsorship deals</a>.

People were floored to learn that the social media star had a set of pipes,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">and in a post-interview</a> with&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly, the 22-year-old shared that the judges told her she should think about launching a music career.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Even after <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I got kicked off the show</a>, the judges were saying the same thing. 'This is going to be life-changing for you. I hope you're ready and I hope you keep making music or you start making music,'" she said. "I don't know what to expect. I think life's about not having expectations, but I think that this just shows a whole different side of me that people didn't even know existed. And that's a cool part of me being on the show, because the world is finding out something new."
