As a teacher, he gave me that little bit extra bit of tutorship that I needed."</p><p id=ex_9TNg-z11j data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>I’m a Celebrity’s James Haskell shows off weight loss in shirtless snap</a></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2ffcffa95440-ian-wright-smiling-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e1_mPgPW56Eu data-wc=12><strong>The former footballer had an impressive career before becoming a TV star</strong></p><p id=eVPDIBUNuiZn data-wc=54>Ian then put his head in his hands and rubbed his eyes before adding: "If it wasn't for him I know I wouldn't be where I am.
