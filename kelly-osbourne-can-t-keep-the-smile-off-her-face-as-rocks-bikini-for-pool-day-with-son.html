We are going to legally change our son's name to have both of our last names. We both made our child, so he should have both of our last names."</p><p id=eL9zAEFmE0 data-wc=27>She and Sid were friends for over two decades before their relationship became romantic after meeting at Ozzfest, the music festival founded by her parents, in 1999.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
