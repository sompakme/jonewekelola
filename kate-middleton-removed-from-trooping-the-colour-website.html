A clue was dropped on March 5 courtesy of England's Ministry of Defense, which revealed that the Princess of Wales was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>scheduled to be present at this year's Trooping the Colour ceremony</a> — but as it turns out, the British Army was mistaken.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People,</a> Kensington Palace said they hadn't been consulted about her appearance at the June 8 Trooping the Colour event — which honors King Charles' birthday — and her name has since been removed from the event's official website. References to King Charles' attendance was also removed from the website.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Originally, the information on the site read, "Trooping the Colour reviewed by Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales is identical to Trooping the Colour reviewed by His Majesty The King, with the exception that some additional mounted officers ride when His Majesty The King is present."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The summary continued, "Taking part will be over 1400 soldiers of the Household Division and The King’s Troop Royal Horse Artillery, including 400 musicians from the Massed Bands, all of whom will parade on Horse Guards for the second of two formal Reviews. Trooping the Colour reviewed by Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales also includes 250 soldiers from the Foot Guards who will line the processional route along The Mall. The soldiers will be inspected by Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales, Colonel Irish Guards."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Middleton's first post-surgery event is TBD, royal observers can expect to see her until after Easter, which falls on March 31 this year. Her children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, are expected to be on break are on school vacation during the Easter holiday, meaning that the Princess of Wales can be expected to make a return to public events likely in mid-April. Until then, fans will have to wait on more pictures of her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>taking car rides with her mother, Carole</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrnmWdnrGluMStpqdlopq6sMLEnWSfqp%2BierW%2BzqinoqaXYsGpsYycpqWnpad6uLHBrKCtnV1tg3GAmG9w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
