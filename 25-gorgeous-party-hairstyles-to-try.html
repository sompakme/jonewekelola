Next, apply a curl-defining cream or mousse to minimize frizz. Use a wide-tooth comb (or your fingers) to gently separate and fluff the curls for added bounce. For more volume, you can add clip-in extensions that match your hair texture. Allow your hair to air-dry, or use a diffuser attachment on low heat to set the curls. Once your curls are dry, gently shake out the roots to add volume and shape.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-copper-curls></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Copper Curls</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ice Spice's captivating copper-coily hair is bound to be a head-turner at any party.

Start by applying a heat-protectant spray to shield your hair from damage. Then use a round brush and a blow-dryer to smooth out your hair with a focus on creating volume at the roots and movement throughout the lengths. As you blow dry, wrap sections of your hair around the brush and pull downwards to achieve sleekness and bounce. Once your hair is dry, use a wide-tooth comb to gently loosen the layers and create texture.

To get the same look, begin by sectioning your hair into small segments, ensuring it’s clean and moisturized. Use synthetic hair extensions to create the locs, wrapping them around each section of your natural hair. Secure the ends tightly and use a crochet hook to tighten and neaten the locs. As you continue, pay attention to the size and length of each loc to achieve a uniform and natural look. Once all the locs are in place, gently dip them in hot water to set the style and secure any loose ends.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-edgy-pixie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Edgy Pixie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have short hair or want to try something bold and unconventional, consider rocking an edgy pixie cut. Janelle Monáe’s carefully tousled waves add texture and movement to her pixie, creating a playful look. Then, the gold floral headband gives a fashion-forward edge. “To create this look, take a half-inch curling iron and curl the hair in different directions, from front to back,” says Kelly. “Use a texture spray and a pomade to shape the hair into the desired look, and finish by placing your hair accessory.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-braided-accent></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Braided Accent</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Braids are the epitome of versatility and can be incorporated into any party hairstyle. This stylish yet simple look is a perfect way to add detail to any style. To create the braids, begin by parting one third of your hair from front to back. Then divide each section into two smaller sections. Take a small piece of hair from the outer edge of the left section and cross it over to the right section. Repeat this process on the right side. Continue alternating sides until you reach the ends and secure with an elastic band. Finally, straighten the remaining hair for a sleek finish.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ring-bun></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ring Bun</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This style is a polished look with a little drama.
