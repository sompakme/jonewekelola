Slipping the brush between the fascia and the gutters will not get the paint where you need it to protect the wood. To paint your home's soffits and eaves, you'll need to spend between 1 and 2 hours for every 25 linear feet.<h2>What color should you paint soffits?</h2>Most soffits are painted the same color as the fascia. Doing this creates a consistent color for the trim that separates the roof from the walls of the house. It is also easier to paint, because you don't need to carefully create a straight line between differently colored fascia and soffits.<h2>TAPING & SPRAYING OUT SOFFITS</h2><p></p><h2>What kind of paint do you use for fascia?</h2>Best exterior paint also made for fascias are typically those having a satin paint sheen.
