She gets up every day with a smile on her face. A 5.30am, whistling in the shower, smile on her face. Then downs two coffees, and gives you the look. The 'what the [expletive] wrong with you, let's do this' look. It's not a pretend smile.</p><p id=eo9NSVUWWBGb data-wc=79>"And it's not just some mornings. It’s every morning. Which is bloody difficult cos she’s married to me. I should also mention she likes a chat. To anyone. About anything. Anywhere.
