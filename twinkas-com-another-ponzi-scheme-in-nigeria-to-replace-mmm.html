In case if a sponsor does not activate his referral after receiving the payment, the same situation will happen - Twinkas will block this account and all other subsequent accounts connected to this bank account and mobile number. They advise downloading some online banking Application on sponsors’ mobile phones to help facilitate the general process. All needed mobile numbers will be always displayed on some specific dashboard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7b0vtdqj8kn.jpg><p class=align-left>A sponsor should save them and beware not receive any calls from other lines telling to have emanated from Twinkas. It must warn their investors against pestering of the numbers for different trivial Issues. People may call these numbers only in the cases of some emergency, for example, hacked accounts or some other serious Twinkas related problems. People can also use the ‘Live Support’ and their Ticketing System for different serious Twinkas issues.

However, previously a lot of Nigerians had been warned against MMM Africa a couple months before it was distress and had yet to fully pick up. Nigerians were also warned by the CBN not to invest money in any institution that has not been insured by the NDIC (Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2fff90ac765a7cc9.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The future belongs to creators, says Rotimi Bankole as he launches SBI Media Workshop</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The Director of Corporate Communications, whose name is Mr. Isaac Okoroafor, has also warned Nigerians about MMM schemes. Okoroafor said that now when the economy had already suffered some decline, all Nigerians had to be extremely careful with companies and people they deal with.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/413289b3815b26cb.jpg><p class=align-left>Also, any institution that has not been licensed by the CBN to get deposits must not be given money to keep under any pretext. He added that they could vouch for the whole banking system. And the deposit money banks have always been the only licensed Nigerian institutions to accept deposits.</p><p class=align-left>If you want to deposit money, then go to one of the licensed deposit money banks and give your money there, you can buy, for example, fixed income instruments or you can invest in different stocks. The experts say that people often come with different interesting propositions. But there are a lot of fraudsters who are ready to collect money of Nigerian people and disappear as soon as they reach the goal. There isn’t any insurance as the NDIC cannot protect Nigerians against different risks when they happen.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6079a88c5badab6a.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Infinix to launch most powerful gaming and entertainment smartphone ever</span></p></a><p class=h2>Latest news on MMM scheme</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytmobc7d1klto.jpg><p class=align-left>Famous Ponzi scheme which is called ‘MMM’, has spread like real wildfire and a lot of people have signed on to this dangerous scheme, which the promoters call ‘a mutual fund’. MMM offered the participants 30 per cent growth rate per month for every donation they make into the system.</p><p class=align-left>MMM belongs to the scheme, which sustainability depends on members’ activities, which make up the general Nigerian MMM community. That means all MMM Nigeria participants. Usually, MMM promoters offer rates far beyond the numbers that are obtainable in any commercial bank. Of course, it attracts a lot of people who rush to become rich. But, unfortunately, people only lose money and get nothing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2fff90ac765a7cc9.png><p class=align-left>In December 2016, the MMM subsidiary in Nigeria suspended work for 30 days. Mavrodi explained the temporary closure of the department by disagreements with the government and the media, which, he said, were spreading rumors about the Internet pyramid, which had hindered its development. As a result, about three million depositors lost their funds totaling $ 16 million.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d0e2db1abfb556d1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>CBN’s FX restrictions killing our businesses, Nigerians cry out</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Nigerian authorities and banks also tried to protect people from fraud, but it was impossible to influence inspired investors. After the closure of the Nigerian branch of ‘MMM’, a branch of the Internet pyramid appeared in Ghana and Kenya.</p><p class=align-left>In January 2017, the Commission on Economic and Financial Crimes and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Nigeria said that organizations like ‘MMM’ represent a direct ‘threat’ to citizens.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt7npf43bltvj.jpg><p class=align-left>But this again did not diminish the popularity of MMM, and in the same month, the branch of the financial pyramid opened again in Nigeria, announcing the opportunity to invest money through bitcoins. The depositors promised that their lost funds would be compensated in the form of bonuses. And on YouTube, there are more and more videos with Nigerians, who are happy with the return of ‘MMM’ in their country.</p><p class=align-left>If you have ever wanted to become any Ponzi scheme or MMM member – forget about it.
