The third hour, called “Head Full of Snow,” is no exception, including Shadow Moon (Ricky Whittle) and Mr. Wednesday (Ian <span data-scayt_word=McShane data-scaytid=4>McShane</span>) pulling off a clever bank robbery, complete with the snowy magic trick from which the episode earns its title.</p><p class=p2>Then there’s the 10-minute sequence culminating in a literally and figuratively fiery sexual encounter between a young Middle Eastern man named <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=5>Salim</span> (<span data-scayt_word=Omid data-scaytid=6>Omid</span> <span data-scayt_word=Abtahi data-scaytid=7>Abtahi</span>) and a taxi-driving god, which is lifted directly from <span data-scayt_word="Gaiman's" data-scaytid=8>Gaiman’s</span> text.&nbsp;</p><p class=p2>The scene begins with <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=10>Salim</span>, who originally hails from Oman and recently moved to New York City to pursue a new life, experiencing an unsuccessful day in his new job as a salesman. He decides to take a taxi ride back to his hotel, leading to a conversation with his driver (<span data-scayt_word=Mousa data-scaytid=12>Mousa</span> <span data-scayt_word=Kraish data-scaytid=13>Kraish</span>), a man who just so happens to be from Oman as well, and indeed is more than just a man: Je is a Jinn, also called an <span data-scayt_word=Ifrit data-scaytid=14>Ifrit</span>, a mythical creature born from fire.&nbsp;</p><p class=p2>The two forge an immediate emotional connection, and it soon becomes a physical one after <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=15>Salim</span> invites the Jinn upstairs to his hotel room. In the novel, as they have sex, <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=16>Salim</span> imagines “the desert on [the Jinn’s] skin,” and the <span data-scayt_word=Starz data-scaytid=25>Starz</span> series adapts this passage visually by showing <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=17>Salim</span> and the Jinn turning into towering creatures in a faraway desert, having sex atop sand dunes, ending with a blazing climax. When <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=18>Salim</span> wakes up the following morning, the Jinn is gone, his forms of identification and car keys still lingering. <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=19>Salim</span> takes these possessions as his own, and embarks on a new life as a taxi driver.</p><p class=p2>In the novel, <span data-scayt_word="Salim's" data-scaytid=76>Salim’s</span> story is one of many that was designed to explore the central theme of immigrating to and finding new life in America, sitting alongside <a href=#>episode two’s Mr. Nancy (Orlando Jones) sequence</a> as well as <a href=#>the series premiere’s violent V<span data-scayt_word=viking data-scaytid=27>iking</span> vignette</a>. For his part, executive producer and <span data-scayt_word=co-showrunner data-scaytid=29>co-showrunner</span> Bryan Fuller believes that the <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=28>Salim</span> and Jinn scene was important to include in his <i>American Gods </i>adaptation for another reason.</p><p class=p2><img decoding=async width=928 height=619 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/2fa2867a-e45c-49df-b294-a1da00d2d711-embed.jpg alt="Omid Abtahi and Mousa Kraish, as Salim and The Jinn in 'American Gods', share a close and intimate moment in an elevator, highlighting their deep emotional connection." style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=p2>Speaking with <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=31>THR</span>, Fuller says the sexual content of <i>American Gods </i>is designed to explore “in a sex-positive way the human relationship to our own sexuality” and “what it is to bond and join and physically become one with another human being, and leave our individual sense of self behind and become something greater than what we were before we were penetrating or being penetrated or entwined in whatever respect we were going to be entwined with another.”&nbsp;</p><p class=p2>“That’s something for me as a man in my <span data-scayt_word=40s data-scaytid=32>40s</span>, it took me the greater part of my life to really know how to enjoy and understand sex from a spiritual level,” says Fuller. “My testicles dropped in the ‘<span data-scayt_word=80s data-scaytid=33>80s</span> — or the ‘<span data-scayt_word=AIDSies data-scaytid=34>AIDSies</span>,’ I should say. As a gay man, I thought I could give myself AIDS if I was masturbating and had a cut on my hand. My sense of sex and sexuality was something that always had an element of fear or shame because I was different than the standard that was providing me information.”&nbsp;</p><p class=p2>In approaching <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=35>Salim</span> and the Jinn’s sex scene from that very personal perspective, Fuller felt it was important to change one aspect of the encounter from how it was originally written in the book.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=p2>“To portray <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=38>Salim</span> and the Jinn in a way that’s sex positive for a gay man who comes from a country where homosexuality is punishable by death and you can be thrown off of a rooftop,” he explains, “it was very important to us to look at <span data-scayt_word="Salim's" data-scaytid=41>Salim’s</span> story as a gay man from the Middle East whose sexual experience was probably relegated to back alley <span data-scayt_word=blowjobs data-scaytid=53>blowjobs</span> and didn’t have an intimate personal sexual experience. In the book, <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=39>Salim</span> blows the Jinn in the hotel, and then he’s gone. It was important for us in this depiction to have <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=40>Salim</span> drop to his knees and prepare to achieve sex the way he’d been accustomed to, and the Jinn lifts him off of his knees and kisses him and treats him much more soulfully and spiritually to change his perception of who he is and what his sexual identity has become. That felt like it was empowering in a different way, showing a protagonist as the one who is being penetrated. That comes with all sorts of preconceptions of gender roles and what it is to be a gay man at the same time.”</p><p class=p2>“What we wanted to achieve there is for an audience who might not necessarily be accustomed to seeing two men having sex, to recognize it as a beautiful thing,” the writer continues, “as opposed to ‘Ooh, Alec Baldwin is kissing that old man!’ Or, ‘Whoopi Goldberg is touching that woman’s hand, what does it mean?’ I’ve been seated in that audience as a gay person, and resented the cringing and cajoling and jeering of audiences, and wanted to show a Middle Eastern gay kid who might find this [show] somehow and see that scene and realize there are people out there who don’t think he’s an abomination.”</p><p class=p2>Fuller believes that the violence of <i>American Gods </i>would still be possible if the series was airing on a network, given what NBC allowed him to display in the visceral <i>Hannibal</i>, as an example — but what about the scene between <span data-scayt_word=Salim data-scaytid=54>Salim</span> and the Jinn?</p><p class=p2>“They wouldn’t have let us show penises and acts of sexual content because America has a very f—<span data-scayt_word=ked data-scaytid=56>ked</span> up relationship with sex,” he says. “You can kill somebody, but you can’t make love to them. That’s a greater issue that we won’t be conquering in probably either of our lifetimes.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=p2>Let us know your take on the latest <i>American Gods </i>episode in the comments below, and <a href=#>keep following</a> for more interviews and coverage of the show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOmqSeqpmYrq95xqibrGWSp8aiuoyfrKWklad6psTPpZiipqNixKq4w2acpqifrLKztc2gZKydqGLApLHNnmRqaGBofnmFjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
