The House of Mouse revealed Thursday that the hit Japanese original has been renewed for a second season, dropping a teaser trailer that offers a peek at what’s to come (see it below).</p><p>The first season of Gannibal was a pillar title for Disney+’s push into Japanese live-action series production. Following its release in December 2022, it became the streaming service’s most-watched locally produced original series in Japan ever. Gannibal‘s star, Yuya Yagira, also earned a best actor nomination at the Busan <a href=# id=auto-tag_international data-tag=international>International</a> Film Festival’s upcoming <a href=# id=auto-tag_asia data-tag=asia>Asia</a> Contents Awards & Global OTT Awards.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Starring some of the biggest names in the Japanese screen industry, Gannibal‘s second season will see the return of Yagira as police officer Daigo Agawa; Show Kasamatsu as Keisuke Goto, the head of the Goto family; and Riho Yoshioka as Yuki Agawa, Daigo’s strong and supportive wife.</p><p>Set in a fictional Japanese village, season one of&nbsp;Gannibal&nbsp;follows recently relocated police officer Daigo as he arrives at his new job and home as a broken man. As Daigo wrestles with his guilt over an event that traumatized his daughter, things start off promisingly, before a series of alarming events quickly lead him to the horrifying realization that something is deeply wrong with the villagers and the mysterious Goto family who seem to run the town.
