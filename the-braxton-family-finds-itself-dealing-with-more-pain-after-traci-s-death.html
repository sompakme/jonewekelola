After all, <a href=#>Surrat was incarcerated twice</a> before marrying their sister. <a href=#>Tamar mentioned</a> it on an episode, and, at one stage,&nbsp;<a href=#>Traci was tired of her sisters&nbsp;insulting her husband</a>. Now, a source told <a href=#>Page Six</a> that Traci's death has sparked tension within the family.&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently, Traci did not want a funeral or wake, and the sisters are furious that Surrat and Traci's manager reportedly went against her wishes and arranged a viewing after her death. On the other hand, Surrat claims that he is complying with Traci's wishes. He said that she "wanted a viewing and one memorial service in conjunction with her management, PR, and other members to come together and celebrate her." He feels that now that Traci has died, her sisters are "treating me like a [deadbeat] husband." Allegedly, the Braxton sisters insist that Traci only wanted them to have a private memorial service for her. So, on April 2, the day Traci would have turned 51, they want to "celebrate her life." Toni told Tamron Hall (via <a href=#>People</a>) that they were going to have a "Traci day."</p><p>Whether or not the Braxton sisters' allegations are true, hopefully the Braxton family, including Traci's husband and son, can come together to support each other right now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWlna4Bxe9OhnGaaopbFtbvNZp2apZmhxm6yyKebrGWZqcCmuMVmm56ZnJ67qHnWoquhZZ2kv6Z5z5qgp2WRm8GmvoytqZqbmah6pbHArZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
