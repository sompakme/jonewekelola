Kiely starts throwing shade in the clip by pointing out, “I’ve been in two multi-platinum, successful groups and they weren’t disbanded.”&nbsp;Farrah fires back&nbsp;with, “And I’ve been in the biggest one and they're still together." However, Kiely makes a very important distinction that,&nbsp;“I know, but you weren’t in it," referring to when Farrah got kicked out of Destiny's Child early on in the group's career. “I was in it," Farrah insists. "I sold 19 million albums on 'Say My Name.'" Kiely&nbsp;goes on to imply that it wasn't exactly Farrah's vocals that led to that record's success.

Ask." Farrah says. "Did you s—" Kiely trails off. "Absolutely, I did sing." The footage then cuts to Farrah attempting to prove that she did, in fact, sing in the group, by belting out the hook of "Say My Name." This viral back-and-forth has the Internet going crazy, with everyone wishing we could see more of this lost series.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Staff Writer&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Originally from Vancouver, Lynn Sharpe is a Montreal-based writer for HNHH.
