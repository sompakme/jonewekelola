The 41-year-old took to Instagram to share a fun, short video showing her mouthing along to Adele's , writing alongside: "Back to the grindâ€¦ Monday yet again. Start the week the right way with a little #studiosingalong."&nbsp;It comes after photographs showing Jenni and her Heart FM colleague Jamie were published in the <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Sun</a></strong>, taken after the duo attended Global's Make Some Noise charity ball. However, it seems the hand-holding was simply an act of friendship; both Jamie and Jenni have been happily married for a number of years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/51242bf28930-jenni-falconer-husband-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eDKw8UwR6Zw5 data-wc=10><strong>Jenni Falconer has been married to James Midgley since 2010</strong></p><p id=ekFvbSwo6UYJ data-wc=88>The duo joined a host of other famous faces at the ball, with Jamie, 45, looking smart in a tuxedo, and 41-year-old Jenni choosing a striking strapless green dress for the occasion. An onlooker told the newspaper: "Jamie and Jenni left together and seemed very close. They were holding hands as they waited for cabs."&nbsp;But the source added: "There was nothing for either of their partners to worry about as they left separately. Although they looked close, it was more on a friendly level than anything else."</p><p id=eKD3kRr5Hmp8 data-wc=60>Jenni fronts Heart FM's , between 4am and 6am. She has been married to husband James Midgley since 2010 and together they share a six-year-old daughter, Ella. Jamie, meanwhile, hosts alongside <a class=hm-link href=#>Emma Bunton </a>between 6am and 9am. He has been married to Sophie Siegle since 2007 and they have two sons together, Sidney, nine, and eight-year-old Kit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f971991933a5-jamie-theakston-wife-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ebaxvX5jxlrB data-wc=7><strong>Jamie Theakston with his wife Sophie Siegle</strong></p><p id=ecI5--PAlAWh data-wc=125>Other celebrities attending the charity ball included <a class=hm-link href=#>Kate Garraway</a>, <a class=hm-link href=#>Charlotte Hawkins</a>, Myleene Klass and Peter Jones. Charlotte attended the glamorous event with her husband, Mark Herbert, with the pair posing with their arms wrapped around one another as they walked the red carpet. The star took part in the year's <a class=hm-link href=#>Strictly Come Dancing</a>, partnered with Brendan Cole, but the pair were <a class=hm-link href=#>eliminated in the fourth week</a> in a dance-off against actor Davood Ghadami. Speaking at the time, Brendan said: "Quite often you stand in this position and you go, 'Hey it was our time to go', and perhaps today it was our time to go. Not often you stand here with such sadness and go 'I'm going to miss this and I'm going to miss hanging out with this girl.'"</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
