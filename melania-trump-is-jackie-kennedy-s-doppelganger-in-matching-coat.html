Her decision to wear gloves completed the retro look which emulated Jackie's demure style. According to the Melania had previously named Jackie O as one of her style icons. Back in 1999 she was asked what her style would be should she ever become First Lady, and she replied: "I would be very traditional. Like&nbsp;Betty Ford or Jackie Kennedy." Her look was also compared to Jackie's own inauguration outfit back in 1961, as the wife of John F. Kennedy also wore a powder blue outfit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/190b1e059fac-jackie-a.jpg><p class=text-center id=e_6hlOINptTp data-wc=9><strong class=redactor-inline-converted>Jackie also wore powder blue during her husband's inauguration</strong></p><p id=ebUn-rPW1cfP data-wc=116>The former model's evening gown for the inaugural ball was compared to former First Lady Nancy Reagan's style, and the dress designer <a class=hm-link href=#>Herv√© Pierre opened up</a>&nbsp;about working with Melania to create the look. In a statement, he said: "It was fun to respect her very tailored sense of fashion and to translate it in a gown. The lines are sharp, the design has no fuss and reflects Mrs. Trump's vision of fashion and the way she feels in a gown. She knows what she likes. Our conversations were, and are, very easy. She knows about fashion, as a former model. She is aware about constructions, so we have already the same vocabulary when it comes to designing a dress." &nbsp;</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
