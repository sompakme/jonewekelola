Her birth name is Rachel India True. She has three siblings and is the middle of them all. Rachel True parents came from different descents. True comes from a family where the father is Jewish. On the other hand, her mother’s descent can be traced to be African American and Native American. True attended the New York University. Details concerning what courses she was doing have not been revealed yet. However, there are speculations that the course must have revolved around acting.</p><p class=align-left>The reason for these speculations is because after she graduated from the New York University, she made her first appearance in <i><a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">The Bill Cosby Show</a></i>. She made a breakthrough on screens after her appearance in 1991 on the scene “Theo’s Final Final” of the Cosby show. It seems this appearance was her beginning to stardom, since later after featuring in the Bill Cosby Show, she made other several appearances. However, these appearances only came after her relocation to Los Angeles.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/171d4f653bd721d7.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Lydia Bright bio: who is this reality TV star?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These included the appearances on the following shows: The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Beverly Hills, Getting By, 90210, and Dream On. Rachel got to make an appearance in the film by the name CB4 in 1993. Since she was getting a character role in almost every hit film of the ’90s, it is only right to say that she is a talented actress and producers were taking note of her talent. Rachel was so diverse that she made an appearance in a horror film by the name Embrace of the Vampire.</p><p class=align-left>Her debut came in the 1996 film known as The Craft. In this film, the actress played the role of an associate of a youngster coven. Since all her character roles were very different, it was evident that she could feature in a film of any genre. In 1997, the beautiful and talented actress featured in a movie by the name Nowhere then made an appearance in another film by the title Half Baked in 1998. One thing we can all agree on is that Rachel was a force to reckon with and was proving to be a threat in the '90s film industry.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0c9d278fc69e022e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are the best female comedians in the world?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The actress also had the persistent character of Janet Clemens on The Drew Carey Show from 1997 to 1998.
