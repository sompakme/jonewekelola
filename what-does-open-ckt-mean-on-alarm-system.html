On the primary control panel of most household alarm systems, there is a display screen that shows which sensor is causing the beeping to occur. Occasionally, bypassing the zone where the sensor is located for a brief period of time is necessary to resolve a house alarm system that is always sounding.</p><p></p><h3>What exactly is a communication failure on alarm?</h3><p>When you see the message “Com Fail” on your security system keypad, it signifies that your control panel attempted to transmit a message to the central station but failed.
