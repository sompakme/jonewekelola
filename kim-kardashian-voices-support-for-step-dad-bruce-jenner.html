I don't know what life would be like if you always felt like you weren't yourself. And I know it's not something that you or I could really fully understand, but I don't even think we have to. I think as long as he's happy and he wants to live his life, however he wants to live it, that just makes me happy, and I support him 100 per cent."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eCc6qQv-lvuR data-wc=25>The mother-of-one revealed that although the family are all happy for Bruce, there has been a big "adjustment" in how to deal with his transition.</p><p id=eJyAVIngWI5- data-wc=36><strong>"I think there is still an adjustment, and there's family therapy</strong>. We're really close…We all really support him. Is it a hard adjustment? Yes…It's an adjustment on how to deal with it. It's a daily process."</p><p id=eToM6bOW6io4 data-wc=27>Kim also revealed that she and her siblings <a class=hm-link href=#>Kourtney</a>, <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Khloe</a> </strong>and <a class=hm-link href=#>Rob Kardashian</a> have all been talking with LGBT organisations in a bid to get any questions they have answered.</p><p id=euKmcH1ICoAd data-wc=17>"What do we call him?

Say what you want about us, but we work out everything as a family</strong>, and we have the best communication and we are so in sync with each other," Kim said. "I love having so many siblings and such a supportive mom, because each family member might be dealing with this in a different way, but we have each other to go through this experience with, and I'm really grateful for that."</p><p id=ejCnuJRTKwjG data-wc=43>After months of speculation, Bruce confirmed he is transgender in an emotional interview with Diane Sawyer on Friday.
