Her dad, <strong>Rut Hawn</strong>, was in a band and encouraged her musical talent.

When she confessed to her mother, Laura, that she hated her name, she got an earful.<p id=eB0C4bGaV1dJ>"I called you Goldie after the woman who meant the most to me in my life," her mom replied. "I also gave you that name because I knew nobody would ever forget it."</p><p id=eYDZmyfPA62h>Laura would appear in two of Goldie's films: <i>Swing Shift</i> and <i>Deceived</i>.</p><p id=ezMUU1Wod82n>Photo: © Joseph Klipple/Getty Images</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dac24ed69eda-gallery35-a.jpg><p id=e8qYwHldwA3E>Goldie ran her own ballet school in Washington, D.C. before trying her luck in New York City.

She's seen on set with <strong>Ronnie Schell</strong> in the image in the right.<p id=e9GiSIfchNrs>"Lambchop helped me through my early troubled years of success," she said.</p><p id=eSCPbOBTpA_e>Photo: © Joseph Klipple/Getty Images</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c0f94caddd50-gallery35-a.jpg> Goldie was the one two watch - literally – in the hippie era.

Goldie was in London filming with <strong>Peter Sellers</strong>, so <strong>Raquel Welch</strong> (right, with best supporting actor <strong>Gig Young</strong>) accepted on her behalf.<p id=e-Jco3kaUHa8>Photo: © Bettmann/Getty Images</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2b18ba9491f3-gallery53-a.jpg> When Goldie - then pregnant with daughter <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kate Hudson</a></strong> –&nbsp;was offered the chance to co-produce as well as star in 1980's <i>Private Benjamin</i>, it boosted her career confidence. She's seen in a still from the film with co-star <strong>Mary Lou Glass</strong> at left.<p id=eCkSITBuWmP->"I didn't plan on becoming a producer... I only wanted to create better roles for myself," she later said.</p><p id=eRHGJNRLf0i3>Photo: © Warner Bros/Archive Photos/Getty Images</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5f5c8a9c577b-gallery11-a.jpg> At 39, twice-divorced Goldie couldn't believe her luck when she reconnected with an actor six years her junior while filming 1984's <i>Swing Shift</i>.<p id=ewPXlXH_6nkv>"A miracle appened. <strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Kurt Russell</a></strong> was sent to us by God.

She disproved her line in that film: "There are only three ages for women in Hollywood: Babe, District Attorney and Driving Miss Daisy."<p id=eG9Jil-MHfeoO>Photo: © Hulton Archive/Getty Images</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/36aa9c38e892-gallery53-a.jpg> Meditation and mindfulness have helped Goldie through difficult times. Her global MindUp program – funded through the Goldie Hawn FOundation – helps children manage stress and anxiety by teaching skills and mindfulness. She's seen at left at her 2014 Love In For Kids fundraiser.

When Kate was pregnant with son <strong>Ryder</strong>, now 16, she felt sad and asked her mom why.<p id=ewfagIdidu0US>"Mom's like 'Because the second they leave your body, they don't belong to you anymore.'
