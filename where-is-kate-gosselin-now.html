As always, my first priority remains our children.”</p><p>Jon also issued a statement of his own, saying: “This afternoon, Kate filed for divorce. Our kids are still my number one priority. I love them and want to make sure they stay happy, healthy and safe. My job is being the best, most supportive and loving father that I can be to my kids, and not being married to Kate doesn’t change that.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>After Kate Plus 8 ended, Kate went on to guest star in a handful of reality shows, including <a href=#>Dancing with the Stars</a>, <span id=5c2312d8-d226-4b26-b0b3-29191d141680 class=suggested-link>Celebrity</span> Wife Swap, and The Apprentice.</p><p>In 2019, she even had her own reality <a href=#>dating</a> show, Kate Plus Date, which had her going on dates with bachelors.
