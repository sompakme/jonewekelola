It's his home city, after all, and the city where he makes his grand living. In 2010, Osteen and his wife, Victoria, bought a mansion in the River Oaks suburb of the city. They live there with their two children: daughter Alexandra and son Jonathan. For the last decade, the Osteen family has been living there. The house is located in the wealthy subdivision of Tall Timbers.</p><p dir=ltr>Their home is 17,000 square feet and sits on close to two acres of land (via <a href=#>CultureMap Houston</a>). The Osteen house, which boasts five wood fireplaces, has a total of six bedrooms, six bathrooms, three elevators, a guest house, a large outdoor pool in the backyard, and a pool house. Quite a lot of space for a family of four. Nevertheless, it didn't come cheap. Osteen paid $10.5 million for it in 2010, noted&nbsp;<a href=#>Velvet Ropes</a>. It is very likely the value of the home is higher now. <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Joel Osteen's house may be worth between $14 to $16 million today.</p><p dir=ltr>The couple reportedly also has a&nbsp;5,600-square-foot home in the Tanglewood area of Houston. That house is worth&nbsp;about $2.9 million, according to <a href=#>Distractify</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAmGpramlfnbKzsdJmn6ivXaLCpLSMo6aepF2kwLWxxKeqZqWRo8Cqu81mqZ6ZnKHGbq%2FOrKusZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
