In an interview with <a href=#>People</a>, he confessed that he had been quite the womanizer during his younger years, and looking back, he couldn't believe that he used to be capable of being unfaithful. "I know I made my share of mistakes, and sometimes big ones," Lopez said. "I had to learn all my lessons the hard way."</p><p>Lopez recalled one time when he screwed up colossally. When <a href=#>he was with former Miss USA Ali Landry</a>, he confessed that he cheated on her before they tied the knot. "I got inebriated and a little too friendly with a young lady," Lopez said of his bachelor party in his memoir, <a href=#>"Just Between Us"</a>. He then realized that he wasn't in love, but was too afraid to call off the wedding. "I walked down the aisle [anyway]. Ali was hurt and angry, rightfully so." Meanwhile, Landry dished on the <a href=#>"Unfolding Leadership" podcast</a> that Lopez had repeatedly been cheating on her throughout their six-year relationship. "I found out that it was, like, a Tiger Woods situation," she said. "It was, you know, cheating across the board, with some women for one year, some women for two years."</p><p>Lopez and Landry split two weeks into the marriage and eventually had it annulled. Lopez also recognized the gravity of his actions, but not until it was all too late.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampnbX9zgI6mmKuhn2K5sLzEs6pmpJ%2Brsm64yJ%2BcZq%2BRqHquwcKhZJ2hlpuys7HNrWSbnZakv6Z5zJqpq7GZo7Ruw8ifnGabn6q%2FtbrEsmSmmaqvrnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
