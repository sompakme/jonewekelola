Those legendary see creatures are not an easy target and they will give you a challenge but also some great rewards which can vastly improve your survivability, and to survive is your main goal in Valheim.</p><p>In order to fight those huge monstrosities, you will need to arm your self with powerful weapons, and one of the best weapons to fight with hostile sea creatures is mighty Abyssal Harpoon.</p><h2>How to make the Abyssal Harpoon in Valheim</h2><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/_eKFCnkhVc_ifixMzwngmEwvSvDSJ23RRYXr7cBx4xg/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzL05ld0ZvbGRlcl8xL1ZhbGhlaW1fQWJ5c3NhbF9IYXJwb29uL1ZhbGhlaW1fQWJ5c3NhbF9IYXJwb29uX2tyYWtlbnMuanBn alt="Valheim Abyssal Harpoon krakens location" width=100% height=auto style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><span>Oceans in Valheim are full of mysterious secrets and terrifying creatures (Picture: Iron Gate)</span></p><p>As with almost all weapons in Valheim, Abyssal Harpoon is only obtainable by crafting.</p><p>You will get the recipe for Abyssal Harpoon the first time you collect Chitin, and here is what materials you need in order to craft Abyssal Harpoon:</p><ul><li>Fine Wood x8</li><li>Leather Scraps x3</li><li>Chitin x30</li></ul><p>You can read our guide to find out <a href=# rel=noopener>how to get Fine Wood</a>, but you probably know that by now.

They are basically small living islands, and while extremely large, they are not hostile and will not attack you nor do any harm.</p><p>While on a ship, search for them in the open ocean and once you spot them, you can step on their back which acts as a land. There are usually some other resources there as well, but we are here primarily because we need Abyssal Barnacles.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/Va5vQPTupz13O3WWkFMqPz332I6aW2B2lna7sH6K5pg/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzL05ld0ZvbGRlcl8xL1ZhbGhlaW1fQWJ5c3NhbF9IYXJwb29uL1ZhbGhlaW1fYWJ5c3NhbF9iYXJuYWNsZXNfbG9vay5qcGc alt="Valheim abyssal barnacles look" width=100% height=auto style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br><span>Abyssal Barnacles are small lumps which you can find on the back of Krakens (Picture: Iron Gate)</span></p><p>You will spot Abyssal Barnacles easily, they look rather nasty, like some kind of ulcer on the surface. Once you spot them, start mining them, but be careful, because Krakens will usually start to move once they notice that you are doing something on their back, so make sure to go back to your boat before they move away too far.</p><p>By mining them, you will automatically get Chitin, which you can use to craft Abyssal Harpoon, provided you have enough of it.</p><p>And that's it, now you have this powerful Harpoon which will help you in a battle against even the mightiest of sea foes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3DCwKWfnqGdZMOiuMeeoKZlkZfGtL%2FApWShmaKlvLC6jKGmsGWkpHqosdNmmKecXay1pr7EZquoZZ2eu6Z5wqGgraGe</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
