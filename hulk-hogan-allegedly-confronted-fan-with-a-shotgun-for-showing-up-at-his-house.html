However, it appears Hogan allegedly confronted a fan with a shotgun for showing up at his house.</p><p>Hulk Hogan is a legendary figure in the world of professional wrestling, with his name being synonymous with the sport. While he has done a lot of questionable things over the years, none of that has erased his importance to the business.</p><p>While speaking on The Wrestling Outlaws, former WWE Superstar EC3 told a story of how Hulk Hogan once allegedly confronted one of his family members with a shotgun for showing up at his house.</p><p>“A black sheep part of my family, apparently, that I don’t talk to, we’re in Clearwater. And they got Hogan’s address, and somebody told them, ‘Yeah, he’s cool. If you just drive up to his house, he’ll take a picture with you.”</p><p>“I just found this out, and this is many years ago. But, like, they’re white trash. But they drove up to Hogan’s house. The gate was open because I think somebody was detailing his car, so the gate was open. They drove out, got out, they’re looking around, and Hogan comes out with a shotgun, going, ‘Who are you, and why are you here?’ He’s like, ‘You can’t come everywhere!’ And he eventually took a picture with him.”</p><p>Hogan also&nbsp;<a href=#>believes he should have ended his pro wrestling career around the 20-year mark</a>. Regardless, we will have to wait and see what’s next in store for the Hulkster, as he has a lot to look forward to in life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>What are your thoughts on the alleged incident involving Hulk Hogan confronting a fan with a shotgun for showing up at his house?
