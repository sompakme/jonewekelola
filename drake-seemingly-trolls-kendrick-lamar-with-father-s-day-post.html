While sharing pictures of himself, his son, Adonis, and his father, Dennis, Drake wrote: "Three generations. Happy <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Father</a>'s Day to the ones guiding their daughters and sons." Lamar infamously attempted to call out Drake for having a daughter on his diss track, "Meet The Grahams," although the Toronto rapper denied the accusation. Lamar didn't provide any proof for the claim either.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Dear, baby girl, I'm sorry that your father not active inside your world / He don't commit to much but his music, yeah, that's for sure / He a narcissist, misogynist, livin' inside his songs / Try destroy families rather than takin' care of his own," Lamar raps on the track. Two days later, Drake fired back with the polarizing, "The Heart Part 6." On that song, he claimed to have fed Lamar false information to bait him.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-amp-adonis-attend-philadelphia-76ers-toronto-raptors-nba-game>Drake & Adonis Attend Philadelphia 76ers-Toronto Raptors NBA Game</h2></span><p>TORONTO, ON - APRIL 7: Drake sits with his son Adonis before the Toronto Raptors play the Philadelphia 76ers in their basketball game at the Scotiabank Arena on April 7, 2022, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

From there, the two each dropped numerous diss tracks over the span of several weeks. Eventually, Lamar went back-to-back with his releases of "Meet The Grahams" and "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Not Like Us</a>," prompting many fans to give him the edge in the battle. Drake then fired back with "The Heart Part 6" to mixed responses.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-celebrates-father-s-day>Drake Celebrates Father's Day</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out the Father's Day post above.
