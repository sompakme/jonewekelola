Did McCall take offense?</p><p>Hickok returned to the same venue the next afternoon. His usual seat against the wall was taken, and in a choice that has reverberated through history, Hickok sat with his back to the room. Jack McCall, a nondescript man with a double chin and crossed eyes, entered quietly, slipped up behind Hickok and put the muzzle of a .45 revolver against the back of the retired lawman's head. "Damn you, take that!" he is said to have shouted as he pulled the trigger. After a moment, Hickok fell sideways out of his chair, dead before he hit the floor. It turned out that the only good bullet in the gun was the one that killed Hickok.</p><p>McCall made a run for it. He jumped on a horse tied outside — it wasn't his — but the saddle had been loosened and he fell off. He took off on foot, and hid in a butcher shop, where he was discovered and jailed. (<a href=#>Calamity Jane</a> would later claim she was the one who found him, but — no. Not even a little.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2BkmtpcWhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStoJViuqK6jLCfqGWbnrmtscNmrqKklGKvqrjLZp%2Bim5ukuHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
