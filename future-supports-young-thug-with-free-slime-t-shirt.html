By the end of the week, Mr. Williams is fighting to pay attention to the goings on in his case.”</p><p>Future isn't the only rapper to voice their support for Young Thug and his associates in recent months. <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Durk</a> reflected on their viral computer meme during an appearance on the Off the Record&nbsp;podcast.
