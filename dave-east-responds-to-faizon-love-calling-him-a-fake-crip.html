But my whole thing is I never met-- respect, bro, like, I don't have no problems with Big Worm. I'm not even gonna say his real name, you Big Worm. That's all n***as know you by. I never met you, never spoke to you, only seen you on Friday as a kid and n***as f*cked with you. I was a fan! I liked your role on Friday. N***a woke up one day and said, 'Dave East ain't a real crip.' Who told you that? Who you went and sat around and gave you that vibe?"</p><p>One of the hosts said that he recently saw Dave East hanging with the crips in Los Angeles, to which he responded, "I move how I move, I got family where I got family. I don't have nothing to prove to a soul. I'll be 33 in June. I'm a grown f*cking man. Who I gotta prove something to? You don't believe it, then you don't believe it. If you know, then you know. I never met him, never spoke to him in my life."</p><p>Check out Dave East's complete response to Faizon Love below.
