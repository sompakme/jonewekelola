I begged and promised to do chores and she broke down and bought them for me. My first adult shoe splurge was on a pair of <span data-scayt_word=Manolos data-scaytid=17>Manolos</span>.

I don’t like to stand in one place over the stove in heels for lengths of time and I don’t want to drip olive oil on my good shoes. I like to give my feet a break and give them good arch support around the house or when running errands in my neighborhood. I very much enjoy being barefoot as well! My feet are moody and demanding.
