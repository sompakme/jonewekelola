However, the 23-year-old has plenty of suitors knocking down her door at this time. She's been taunting her baby daddy relentlessly with her alleged new beau, Lil Mabu. Earlier this week they dropped off a diss track called <a href=# rel>"MR. TAKE YA B*TCH,"</a> which resulted in a minor Twitter <a href=# rel>spat</a> between the two men on Friday (October 20).</p><p>Despite the fact that Rock has been showing off what appears to be a tattoo tribute to Mabu, Crip Mac is still putting in work to get her attention. While visiting Walmart recently, the <a href=# rel>social media star</a> recorded a message to the Cr*zy In Love co-stars, dissing one and expressing his interest in the other.

"Chrisean Rock, I'm gonna bust your coochie and a**hole!" the 30-year-old promised before asking his mother for her opinion on the matter. "I think it's a fabulous idea," she agreed.</p><p>Even if things with Chrisean Rock don't work out, Adam22 has hinted that we could still see Crip Mac get some with his wife, Lena The Plug. After going viral for filming an <a href=# rel>interracial scene</a> with Jason Luv, the adult actress is reportedly now planning a video shoot with multiple men.
