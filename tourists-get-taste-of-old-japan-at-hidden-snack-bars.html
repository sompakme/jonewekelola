class=align-left>Down a Tokyo street lined with bright signs, up narrow stairs and behind a windowless door is a "snack bar" long cherished by regulars but hidden from tourists -- until now.</p><p class=align-left>Snack bars are cosy, retro establishments found across Japan, often crammed into small buildings and equipped with karaoke systems that echo late into the night.</p><p class=align-left>They are typically run by a woman nicknamed "mama" who chats to customers while serving drinks with nibbles such as nuts, dried squid or simple cooked dishes.</p><p class=align-left>Despite being a fixture of Japanese nightlife since the post-war era, the tucked-away bars' tight space can be intimidating, especially for <a href=#>people</a> who don't speak the language.</p><p class=align-left>So one company is offering guided tours to snack bars like Kuriyakko, in the capital's Shimbashi business district.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper

them, or what to do," said the 30-year-old, who is now based in San Francisco and did not want her surname published.</p><img

has run Kuriyakko for 25 years.</p><p class=align-left>It's one of around 100,000 snack bars in Japan, according to Snack Yokocho, and while most are run by women, some have a male "master".</p><p class=align-left>Although the atmosphere is less sexually charged than at modern host and hostess clubs, with the focus on convivial conversation, the history of snack bars is rooted in Japan's red-light districts.</p><p class=align-left>After <a href=#>World</a> War II, some women turned to sex work to survive, but anti-prostitution laws were introduced at the time of the 1964 Olympics, Snack Yokocho representative Mayuko Igarashi told AFP.</p><p class=align-left>So to make <a href=#>money</a>, they "took a simple wooden box to the regular street and served drinks and snacks".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bcc5360090837cf4.jpg><p class=align-left>Little by little, these early snack bars moved indoors to small premises that the women could manage without having to prepare elaborate dishes.</p><a

during the day when the children were around, so after they went to bed, women stood at the counter to work in the evening," she said.</p><h2>Face-to-face</h2><p class=align-left>It's believed there were 200,000 snack bars in Japan in the 1950s and 60s, according to Igarashi, but the number has declined as the "mama" retire or sell up.</p><p class=align-left>Now with record numbers of tourists visiting Japan, Snack Yokocho says interest in its tours is growing.</p><p class=align-left>As well as classic spots like Kuriyakko, the company's guides bring visitors to themed snack bars such as a golf bar with a makeshift putting green.</p><p class=align-left>It also sometimes runs tours for Japanese women who want to experience snack bar culture, but have reservations about knocking on a closed door alone.</p><p class=align-left>For years, the bars' clientele was almost exclusively men, Igarashi said.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px

to relax, or talk to 'mama' about their problems".</p><p class=align-left>People tend to talk on social media, but after a bad day, nothing beats face-to-face communication, she added.</p><p
