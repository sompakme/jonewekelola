It’s also almost certainly the only “vegetarian horror film,” as Park described Were-Rabbit, to win any Oscars at all.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Wallace and Gromit’s adventures began in 1982 as a film-school graduation project, created with 2,200 pounds of Plasticine clay (provided to Park free of charge by the Harbutt company, Plasticine’s creator). Wallace is a chubby-cheeked inventor who loves cheese, loosely based on Park’s father. His inventions are the Rube Goldberg type — “using a sledgehammer to crack a nut” is how Park has described them. Gromit is his highly intelligent pet beagle. (His name is derived from the grommets Park’s electrician brother often mentioned.) Gromit was supposed to speak, but Park realized the character said much more with just a lift of the eyebrow or cock of the head and made him mute. The late actor Peter Sallis, meanwhile, voiced Wallace until 2010.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Were-Rabbit — in which the duo runs a humane extermination service called Anti-Pesto to protect vegetable gardens from rabbits — was Park’s second feature, after 2000’s Chicken Run. (Steve Box, his longtime collaborator at Aardman Animations, served as co-director.) “The studio now hits its stride in a second outing,” raved THR‘s review, “displaying the same technical flair, wonderful British wit and a sharper story sense.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/36Bendpg-tearsheet-EMBED.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This story first appeared in a December stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
