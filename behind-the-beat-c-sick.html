Recently working with artists like Meek Mill, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Durk</a>, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chance The Rapper</a>, as well as keeping up relationships with longtime collaborators <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>King Louie</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Logic</a>, the producer is more recognized than he's ever been, but his work ethic has remained the same throughout.</p><p>As present as Chicago's history is in his music, C-Sick actually spent the first ten years of his life in France. His mother, who grew up in Chicago, studied overseas, where she met the producer's father and started a family. When the two divorced 15 years later, C-Sick's mother decided to bring him and his two sisters back to her hometown, which is where he began making music.</p><p>C-Sick went from casual experiments in juke and footwork to working with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nas</a> in just a few years time. We spoke to him about his beat battle victories, growing up alongside greats like Chance The Rapper, and some of his most well-known production placements.
