Our favorite Regency drama was renewed for both seasons 3 and 4 way back in April 2021, following the record-breaking ratings of season 1. Netflix released the news in a letter from Lady Whistledown herself, reading, "Esteemed members of the Ton, it seems we have a rather special announcement. Bridgerton shall return for seasons three and four. This author shall have to pen more ink..."</p><p>Rhimes also released a statement at the time, saying, "<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/betsy-beers-bridgerton-interview/>Betsy [Beers]</a> and I are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue bringing the world of Bridgerton to a worldwide audience," per <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/tv/bridgerton-renewed-seasons-3-4-netflix/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>People</a>.

"[We] got a little bit creative so we're already hard at work writing season 3...That is already in progress and you'll see. Give it time," she said.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-when-will-bridgerton-season-3-come-out><span>When will 'Bridgerton' season 3 come out?</span></h2><p>After a long wait (over two years!), Bridgerton will finally return this summer with a two-part release of season 3, with Part 1 arriving on <strong>May 16, 2024</strong>, followed by Part 2 on <strong>June 13, 2024</strong>. The eight-episode season will be cleanly split in two, with episodes 1-4 premiering in May followed by 5-8 in June.</p><p>After dropping the news with an initial <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysXcW5K_5Sg" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>date announcement</a> full of tweets and TikToks asking for the next episodes, Netflix marked the third anniversary of Bridgerton's series premiere by debuting a new look at season 3 on Christmas Day 2023. The latest batch of pics include peeks of the many returning Bridgertons, including married couple Kate and Anthony, and Hannah Dodd's debut as Francesca.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pCm4ATZ8k8LHY3c5sr6nQH-1920-80.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guQGn6viz7cW5norUJxgc8-1920-80.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vtpZ5kVvzeMdokQuPdoneS-1920-80.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ykAFYM7dyNGWtpZrKe4P9d-1920-80.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2X9ZU8E8Wzq6hw7LXpxuzm-1920-80.jpeg><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-is-there-a-trailer-for-bridgerton-season-3><span>Is there a trailer for 'Bridgerton' season 3?</span></h2><p>The full season 3 trailer has arrived, and quite a lot has happened since the last time we checked in with the Ton. Penelope is ready to leave the Featherington nest and continue her Lady Whistledown activities as a married woman, but first she'll have to find her confidence in flirting. Meanwhile, Colin has returned from his travels with a glow-up and a mission to reconnect with Pen, so he offers to teach her how to navigate the marriage mart. When this works too well, he has to contend with her suitor, Lord Debling, and his own feelings. At one point he asks his mother, "Do you believe the best foundation for love is friendship?"</p><p>The new clip also offers a look at some of the season's subplots, including Eloise's new friendship with... Cressida Cowper? It seems that Eloise has gone the "enemy of my enemy is my friend" route in her estrangement from Penelope. But who knows? Maybe the mean girl has gone good.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Sign up here.</p><p>On February 1, 2024, Netflix dropped a new clip from the upcoming season, where they started off Valentine's Month by showcasing the romantic tension between Penelope and Colin. The one-minute scene starts in the middle of a loaded conversation between the pair, as Penelope gazes into Colin's eyes and says, "Your eyes are the most remarkable shade of blue, yet somehow they shine even brighter when you are kind." Colin is also lost in the moment, before they both come to their senses. Penelope adds, stuttering, "I might say something like that if you were a suitor."</p><p>On Valentine's Day 2024, Netflix held an exclusive global fan event full of sneak-peek material, including new photos, the season 3 episode titles, and a brand new clip. The one-minute scene between Penelope and Colin takes place at the beginning of the new social season, while Pen is still angry at him overhearing him say he’d never court her at the end of season 2. Even though Colin says that he misses their friendship, Penelope isn't feeling it. "It just never occurred to me that you of all people could be so cruel," she says.</p><p>Meanwhile, executive producer Shonda Rhimes, showrunner Jess Bromwell, and author Julia Quinn teased several new details of the new episodes. Most importantly for the central plot, they teased that Penelope's foremost suitor (and the biggest threat to Colin) will be the dashing Lord Debling (Sam Phillips). “Or Debbers as we like to call him,” Coughlan joked. See the first look at the lord below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ShwRLn4HTfHQPd8fcezzNk-1920-80.jpg><p>On March 20, 2024, Netflix took a break from hyping up Colin and Penelope's highly-anticipated love story to give the people what they want: more Kanthony crumbs! The latest sneak peek from season 3 looks back to season 2's main couple by highlighting a brief (but lovely) moment between newlyweds Anthony and Kate Bridgerton. In the clip from one of season 3's many parties, Anthony takes a break from chaperoning the latest Bridgerton woman on the marriage mart, little sis Francesca, to share a dance with his wife Kate (and steal a quick kiss).</p><p>The first look at season 3 dropped during the streamer's annual fan event Tudum in June 2023, giving the first glimpse of Colin and Penelope's building romance. Both of the characters look different in the four new pics, with Colin receiving a male-lead glow-up and Penelope dressed in a more muted color scheme (no more yellow dresses!).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5R7TFDvz7MbXr9md3jYVdm-1920-80.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hdsoaJGYKuTpGrrytpyox3-1920-80.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TA975L9TbXBB3VpGaDANm8-1920-80.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/77m7ZnUYtpYtzWEgwR8UBh-1920-80.jpeg><p>Previously, Lady Whistledown-slash-Netflix announced the start of production on season 3 in July 2022 with a video dispatch from the set, which featured all of our faves in different stages of hair and makeup around a traditional British manor. Among the many familiar faces shown are the Bridgertons (minus Daphne, plus Anthony!), Lady Danbury, and the Queen. The clip ends with Penelope herself, Nicola Coughlan, confirming that season 3 has begun filming (while wearing an adorable pair of Crocs).</p><p>The streamer also teased a bit more about the new season during an adorable painting-themed interview, as part of Tudum in September 2022. In the clip, after Colin and Eloise Bridgerton actors Luke Newton and Claudia Jessie paint each other's portraits, Coughlan appears with a copy of the script for season 3's premiere, and reads the first few lines of the episode.</p><p>Season 3's premiere is titled Out of the Shadows, written by new showrunner Jess Brownell and directed by Tricia Brock. It begins in the same tradition as seasons 1 and 2, with Lady Whistledown introducing a new social season:</p><p>"Dearest gentle reader,</p><p>We’ve been apart for far too long. At last, London’s smart set has made its return, and so too has this author. As the season begins, the question on everyone’s mind, of course, is, which newly minted debutante will shine the brightest. The crop this year proves to be rather dazzling indeed. Unfortunately, not every young lady can attract the light."</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-are-the-episode-titles-for-bridgerton-season-3><span>What are the episode titles for 'Bridgerton' season 3?</span></h2><p>Among the many gifts given to Bridgerton fans on Valentine's Day 2024, the Netflix global fan event also included the official titles for all eight episodes of season 3. Fans of Quinn's books will recognize that several of the titles include Easter eggs, as well as the title of the source novel, Romancing Mr. Bridgerton.</p><p>During the fan event's panel discussion, executive producer Shonda Rhimes and showrunner Jess Brownell teased that the new season will explore, and occasionally subvert, the traditional dynamics of a friends-to-lovers storyline. Members of the cast also got the chance to describe the new season in one word, and some of the responses were: intimate, confidence, mysterious, long-awaited, romantic, unpredictable, revelatory and mischievous.</p><p>“I think Colin and Penelope are underdogs in many ways,” Brownell said. “You know you have Penelope, the perennial wallflower, and you have Colin, who’s the third son, who hasn’t quite found himself, and we get to see these characters step into their power this year, which I think will be they’ll make a lot of people who’ve ever had an unrequited crush or feel like an underdog before feel very seen.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rhimes added, "“I really do think this is for the wallflowers, but I also think there’s a line that Lady Danbury says in Queen Charlotte where she says, ‘We are untold stories,’ and I feel like this season really leans into the idea of telling those untold stories. You get to see a little bit of what’s going on emotionally with the more adult ladies in the show.”</p><p>If that wasn't enough info, Netflix also revealed several more images from season 3, included below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cc46vVPkcJy4t9ocNRQVoE-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XNA2oRGQxarFPXPhhZA5ja-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CiS4goRUU6DektpDRUq4pj-1920-80.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sr7wWebarrxussphNHXXh5-1920-80.jpg><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-how-did-bridgerton-season-2-end><span>How did 'Bridgerton' season 2 end?</span></h2><p>The finale saw Anthony and Kate as happy, PDA-heavy newlyweds after they finally get together at the Featherington Ball. BFFs Eloise and Penelope are on the rocks after Eloise finally discovered the Lady Whistledown secret, but in the end, Penelope decided that it will be a long time before she puts down her quill. The intellectual also breaks things off with apprentice Theo because of a fear Penelope puts in her head.</p><p>Among the other storylines, Benedict quits art school after discovering Anthony's large donation got him in. Colin has a brief hero moment revealing Lord Featherington's scam, and then breaks Penelope's heart when she overhears him telling his friends that he'd never court her. Kate's sister Edwina and mom Mary will also be sticking around London, with Queen Charlotte mentioning that she might set up Edwina with her nephew Prince Friedrich (Freddie Stroma), who wooed Daphne in season 1.</p><p>And while Regé-Jean Page is not, repeat not, returning to the world of Bridgerton, he's open to the series recasting Simon. "They're free to do as they like," he told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/rege-jean-page-bridgerton-recasting-netflix-the-gray-man-1235316524/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Variety</a>. (He also revealed he isn't yet caught up on the second season, months after its release on Netflix—ouch!)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xw5mWpouoNTEwGgPZxsbyV-1920-80.jpg><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-which-julia-quinn-book-will-bridgerton-season-3-be-based-on><span>Which Julia Quinn book will 'Bridgerton' season 3 be based on?</span></h2><p>If the series continued to follow the order of Quinn's series, the next novel would be <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.amazon.com/Offer-Gentleman-Bridgerton-Bk/dp/0380815583 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=141596&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FOffer-Gentleman-Bridgerton-Bk%2Fdp%2F0380815583%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id=1471 data-merchant-url=amazon.com data-merchant-network=Amazon>An Offer From a Gentleman,</a> a Cinderella-esque story of Benedict's love story with Sophie Beckett, an earl’s daughter forced into servitude by her hateful stepmother. For anyone confused why the next leading Bridgerton wouldn't be a woman, the order of the books started with Daphne, then follows the children in alphabetical/age order (Anthony, Benedict, Colin, Eloise, Francesca, Hyacinth, Gregory).</p><p>However, the Netflix show has decided to star another sibling earlier than expected. During a panel conversation at Netflix's FYSEE event, Coughlan revealed that next season will follow Colin and Penelope's romance, which will be complicated by Penelope's activities as Lady Whistledown and her falling out with Eloise.</p><p>"Like Lady Whistledown, I have been keeping a secret for quite some time and I can confirm to you all that season 3 is Colin and Penelope's love story," she said. "I have kept that secret since two weeks into season 2."</p><p>Coughlan also spoke on the decision in a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-3-confirmed-penelope-colin-lead-characters referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100577549/type/dlg/sid/hawk-custom-tracking/https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/bridgerton-season-3-confirmed-penelope-colin-lead-characters data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=netflix.com data-merchant-id=1070 data-merchant-url=netflix.com data-merchant-network=CJ>Tudum</a> article, saying that following Colin and Penelope's story a season earlier makes sense. "I feel like if you see Penelope fawning over this boy for another season, you’ll be like, 'Get it together! Come on, move on and get over it,'" she said. "Jess has talked to Luke and I through the season, and I think people are going to be really obsessed. I think book fans are going to be happy." When asked about how sexy season three would be—super-sexy, like season one; or more chaste, like season two—Coughlan said: "We've had two seasons of build up, it's probably going to be the former."</p><p>New showrunner Jess Brownell elaborated in an <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/why-bridgerton-season-3-penelope-colin-1235268287/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>interview</a> with Variety: "I really feel like it’s Colin and Penelope’s time. Because we’ve been watching both of these actors on our screens since Season 1, we’ve already invested in them a little bit. We know who they are as people...Instead of treading water on that dynamic, we wanted to push it into their season. It really felt like the perfect moment to tee it up.”</p><p>Though this is a surprise for fans of the Bridgerton books, the show's creative team has hinted in recent interviews that it doesn't have to follow the same path. In an <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.etonline.com/bridgerton-who-will-be-the-focus-of-season-3-shonda-rhimes-and-chris-van-dusen-weigh-in-exclusive?utm_source=pocket_mylist" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Entertainment Tonight</a> interview, Rhimes alluded that the show doesn't have to follow the order of the books.</p><p>"There's eight <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a35193245/bridgerton-eight-seasons-books/>Bridgerton siblings,</a> so we're planning on following each one of the siblings' romantic stories. We're not necessarily going in order but we are going to be seeing each of the siblings and their stories."</p><p>The official deviation from the book order means that anything goes for future seasons (assuming that Netflix will definitely renew its biggest hit). Season 4 could go back to Benedict's love story, or maybe have another Bridgerton sister be the lead. In that case, Eloise could be up sooner than the book order, or maybe Francesca, who's set for a bigger role in Season 3.</p><p>In an interview with <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1327020/bridgertons-jonathan-bailey-is-ready-to-see-this-sibling-take-the-lead referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>E!,</a> Jonathan Bailey noted that he's looking forward to Eloise's season. "I can't wait to walk Eloise down the aisle for so many reasons," he said. "Partly because, if there's ever going to be another character that has a bigger arc as Anthony, in terms of having to overcome psychological warfare, it's going to be Eloise." Speaking to The Wrap, he added of Anthony in season 3: "It’s really important to be there because obviously, [Anthony’s] the older bro, but to make space and to make sure that they have their amazing sweeping love story as well.”</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-do-we-know-about-the-plot-of-bridgerton-season-3><span>What do we know about the plot of 'Bridgerton' season 3?</span></h2><p>Netflix revealed the first summary of the upcoming season's plot to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/shondaland-bridgerton-behind-the-scenes/a39991794/everything-about-bridgerton-season-three/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Shondaland</a> back in May 2022. Penelope will seemingly start the season in the same state as she ended season 2, angry at Colin for dismissing her and still not talking to Eloise. Per the outlet, Pen will dedicate herself to the task of finding a husband, since marriage will give her the independence she needs to keep being Lady Whistledown. However, as we saw with Daphne, navigating the social season is no easy task.</p><p>After returning from more summer travels, Colin will get the cold shoulder from his friend and try to win her back by helping her "find the confidence she needs in the marriage mart." As all fans of the friends-to-lovers trope know, situations like these are when hidden feelings come to light.</p><p>Meanwhile, the rift between Penelope and Eloise may grow even wider, as Eloise makes a surprising new friend while Penelope balances the Whistledown secret with her busy social season. Hopefully the friends will reconcile by the end, maybe with Eloise offering Penelope some much-needed help?</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-who-will-be-in-the-cast><span>Who will be in the cast?</span></h2><p>We will officially be getting more appearances from the newlyweds, as Jonathan Bailey (Anthony Bridgerton) and Simone Ashley (Kate Bridgerton née Sharma) are set to appear. Ashley herself shared the news at a Netflix dinner in March 2022, telling <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2022/03/bridgerton-simone-ashley-returning-season-3-1234990971/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Deadline</a> that "Kate and Anthony are just getting started."</p><p>"We're going to be back!" she told the outlet. "In Season 2, there was a lot of push and pull between Kate and Anthony, there were complications with the family, and then they find each other towards the end. I think everything is just starting. I’d like to see Kate just let go a bit more and play more in Season 3 and kind of swim in that circle of love together. I think they both deserve it."</p><p>Later, she added in an interview with iMDB: "I'm excited to see Kate become Viscountess and head of the household. I think she has much to learn from Anthony. They'll be two little partners. I'd love to see them have a baby, to put it simply. Maybe that will happen, maybe it won't."</p><p>With Anthony moving into the role of the most-recently-married Bridgerton, fans were left wondering if Phoebe Dynevor would have a large role as Daphne. Unfortunately, the actress revealed in a January 2023 <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://screenrant.com/bridgerton-season-3-daphne-possible-absence-dynevor-response/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Screen Rant</a> interview that her character will likely be absent in the new season.</p><p>"Sadly, not in season 3. Potentially in the future," she told the outlet. "But season 3, I'm just excited to watch as a viewer."</p><p>All of the other Bridgerton actors—Luke Thompson (Benedict Bridgerton), Claudia Jessie (Eloise Bridgerton), and Luke Newton (Colin Bridgerton)—are also guaranteed to return. Nicola Coughlan (Penelope Featherington) will also move into the leading lady role. Other likely favorites returning include Adjoa Andoh (Lady Danbury) and Golda Rosheuvel (Queen Charlotte).</p><p>We may also (hopefully!) get appearances from Charithra Chandran (Edwina Sharma) and Shelly Conn (Mary Sharma) since their characters are said to be around next social season. Chandran, speaking to Extra, hinted: “Edwina’s love story was with herself and it was epic and life changing. The Bridgerton world is expanding, we call it the Bridgerverse, and Edwina exists somewhere in the Bridgerverse, so who knows what’s in store."</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2022/05/bridgerton-hannah-dodd-francesca-season-3-recasting-ruby-stokes-netflix-1235021613/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Deadline</a> reported that Hannah Dodd will join the show as Francesca, the sixth-eldest Bridgerton child, in the new season. Ruby Stokes, who has played the character for the past two seasons, is leaving the Ton to star in another Netflix show, Lockwood & Co.</p><p>Francesca's story is the sixth book in the series, but Dodd will be a series regular in season 3, so we'll hopefully spend a good amount of time with the least-seen Bridgerton so far. "It’s such a beautiful book and she’s such a beautiful character. I can’t really believe that I get to play her," Dodd told TV Line. “I know how people feel about her as well, so I’m going to do my best."</p><p>"Francesca Bridgerton is a bit of a mystery within her chatty, extroverted family," Netflix said in a statement. "Despite her reserved nature, she goes along to get along when it comes to society affairs, fortified with a dry wit and pragmatism that confound the fickle ton yet seem to draw attention when she least desires it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/weNsf4nPYH44rGVjGkdcLn-1920-80.png><p>With the announcement that filming had begun on season 3, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/shondaland-bridgerton-behind-the-scenes/a39991794/everything-about-bridgerton-season-three/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Shondaland</a> also revealed three new actors coming to the series. Daniel Francis will play Marcus Anderson, a charismatic man who draws both attention and "ire" among the women of the Ton. Francis is a classically trained stage actor who's best known for playing Dave Shaw in the Netflix thriller Stay Close.</p><p>Sam Phillips will play Lord Debling, an eccentric man who has enough money to both sustain his strange interests and draw the women's attention. Phillips also has extensive stage experience, and previously appeared in seasons 3 and 4 The Crown, as well as the film adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Far From the Madding Crowd.</p><p>Rounding out the trio, James Phoon joins the cast as Harry Dankworth, a dashing man whose looks make up for him being a bit dim-witted. Phoon is a rising star who also appears in the upcoming BBC horror-comedy Wreck. He also acted in the play <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/harry-potter/>Harry Potter</a> and the Cursed Child on the West End for two years.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Alert the Ton, we’re back in action! #Bridgerton Season 3 production is in full swing. pic.twitter.com/nNrnpJobsX<a href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/shondaland/status/1549764240029786113 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>July 20, 2022</a></p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-what-has-the-cast-and-crew-said-about-bridgerton-season-3><span>What has the cast and crew said about 'Bridgerton' season 3?</span></h2><p>Several cast members have expressed their excitement in their characters' next steps in their stories. Ashley told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://deadline.com/2022/03/bridgerton-simone-ashley-returning-season-3-1234990971/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Deadline</a> that she wants Kate to thrive in her new marriage and position. “She’s in charge of the household now and she’s got big boots to put on. I think she can do it,” she said. “I want to keep that softness and vulnerability to Kate, for sure, and she can share that with Anthony. I’m just excited for her to have a home and to have a family. I’m excited to see her grow. I think I’d like to see Kate being much braver and less headstrong and more heart strong.”</p><p>Speaking to <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/05/awards-insider-making-of-kate-sharma-bridgerton referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Vanity Fair</a>, Ashley also noted that season three will continue to explore the growing bond between Kate and Anthony. "It's a very surface-level kind of strength to be someone who thinks they can do it all on their own—but, actually, it’s a much deeper rooted strength to depend on others and have others depend on you. So, I’m really excited to see her journey.”</p><p>Luke Thompson also shared his hopes for Benedict in an <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://ew.com/tv/bridgerton-brother-luke-thompson-benedict/?utm_source=pocket_mylist" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Entertainment Weekly</a> interview, where he addressed the possibility that his love story may be up next.</p><p>"The thing is the books are the books, and the show is completely rooted in the books, but it's not tied to the books. ... So, I don't know. The books would indicate that the next one up is Benedict, but we don't know that for sure because the show is the show, and the show has license to do all sorts of things. The show is such an ensemble effort anyway, and it does feel like there's so much to get our teeth into even when you're not in the driver's seat. It's not like I'm sitting around waiting for my 'big moment' because it's such a huge group effort, and that's what makes it satisfying to do. As long as Benedict keeps being explored, I'm happy."</p><p>As for the aftermath of Penelope and Eloise's massive fight, Nicola Coughlan told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.etonline.com/bridgerton-nicola-coughlan-and-claudia-jessie-on-penelope-eloises-big-lady-whistledown-fight-181414 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Entertainment Tonight</a>, "They have to [reconcile]. They have to, because it would break my heart [if they didn't]. Also, I think, in deep life-long friendships, there are moments like that when you do fight and you've just got to learn to grow a little bit. But I think Penelope has got some apologizing to do. I think she has some apologizing to do."</p><p>Claudia Jessie also told the outlet that she wants the friends to make up "as soon as possible," and gave her thoughts on how Eloise might handle the huge secret.</p><p>"I think she'll be a good friend. That's what I think [she] always will be. I think she'll be a loyal friend [who] didn't tell anyone," she hypothesized. "I don't know what's going to happen. I mean, they might match scars but I don't think she will. I think she'll be furious, but then be really respectful and not say anything. I don't think she'll want to ruin Penelope."</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/bridgerton-nicola-coughlan-polin-book-scene-season-2/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>TV Guide</a> interview, Coughlan elaborated on Penelope's stance going into season 3, saying that she thinks the Whistledown author will be "a bit of a savage."</p><p>"I think Penelope is going to be in a dark place because she's lost Eloise and she's lost Colin, so all she has is Whistledown," she said. "I feel like she's going to be a bit of a savage. I think, ultimately, this time around she found herself and lost herself at the same time if that makes sense. She got a little bit more arrogance as time went on because you walk around a ballroom and everyone's going, 'Lady Whistledown is the biggest genius. Oh, she's wonderful. The queen is scared of her.' She's got all this money [and] that's going to have some effect on her, but I think she needed to come back down a few pegs."</p><p>There's also specific scenes from the books that the actors are excited to explore. Mama Bridgerton actor Ruth Gemmell told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a39631478/ruth-gemmell-bridgerton-season-2-interview/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Cosmopolitan</a> that there's a Book 3 scene she'd love for the show.</p><p>"I think it’s in Benedict’s story where there’s a ball, Violet’s hosting it. She’s slightly exasperated by her children, and somebody asks her to dance and she dances. What I liked about that is all the children didn’t like it. Then you catch her eavesdropping on their conversation about: Who on earth is this bloke? I hope they do bring in a bit of that, because there is something lovely about that," she said.</p><p>Luke Newton, who plays Colin, told <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/bridgerton-finale-seasons-3-and-4-romances-1235125819/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The Hollywood Reporter</a> that he hopes to get a Whistledown reveal scene similar to the one Eloise got in season 2.</p><p>"I hope sooner rather than later, because I’m dying to know his reaction. He’s obviously got a very close connection with her, just like Eloise does, but I think it’s difficult because…is he over the stuff with Marina? That’s the only scandal that he’s really been involved in with Whistledown. But then, is he going to be OK with being lied to for however many years? It’s put his family in very difficult positions every now and then," he said. "So it’s definitely going to stir things up, particularly now with Eloise sort of writing off her best friend. It’ll be really interesting if Penelope has any loyalty to the Bridgertons at all, because they’ve been kept quite safe because of their connection. And now she isn’t close with anyone because Colin’s been horrible and Eloise has found out everything. I’m really excited to see how the Bridgertons are treated next year."</p><p>Meanwhile Adjoa Andoh told the outlet that she wants to see Lady Danbury collaborate with other characters in later seasons, including Eloise and Penelope.</p><p>"I have to say, although she appears not to give her much attention, I think [Lady Danbury] quite liked Lady Featherington,” she added. "I think there’s something about Lady Featherington’s determination. I would really love to see a bit more of them."</p><p>She's also hoping to see her character in a romance. "I would love Lady Danbury to have someone to love. It would be so great. And I just love her appetite. So I would love anything that allows more of that appetite to be present," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJulocG2vsRoq69lo528uL%2BOm6minJeav7W7zWaqnpmjpLtuf44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
