In August 2020, <a href=#>TMZ</a> confirmed that the young couple had split after nearly two years of dating. According to the outlet, the pair made the decision to part ways mutually, with insiders claiming that Jackson had instead decided to focus on herself and her music and was in the studio nearly every day.</p><p dir=ltr>Jackson first appeared to hint at trouble in paradise during the final episode of her and Glenn's Facebook Watch series, "<a href=#>Unfiltered: Paris Jackson and Gabriel Glenn</a>," which aired around the time of their breakup. Admitting that they were "constantly butting heads," she explained, "A big thing for Aries is we are very impatient, depending on what it is." Calling theirs "a very interesting dynamic," she added, "We both have double stubborn energy. I've always known I was stubborn, and I knew that he was stubborn, because he's a Taurus." Jackson also noted that Glenn was just "one of many soulmates."</p><p dir=ltr>For his part, Glenn also seemed to give a glimpse at a future in which he and Jackson were apart, telling viewers, "I think we said it when we first got together, even if we didn't work out as a couple, we always want to be in a band together. Our music was one thing that we wanted to hold on to no matter what."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2pnZYR0e8inqqKclWK9or7IrGSjmZOgwLC60maaqKWgobakrdOem2akn6uybrjIn5xo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
