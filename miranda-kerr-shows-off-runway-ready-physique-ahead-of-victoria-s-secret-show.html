And <span><strong>Miranda Kerr</strong></span> is also in the middle of shooting the lingerie giant’s new season campaign. But the supermodel, who is no doubt used to juggling hectic schedules since <a class=hm-link href=#>becoming a mum</a> to baby boy Flynn in 2011, seems to be far from fazed by her busy week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/274beddff582-miranda-kerr1-z.jpg><p id=eiUYSfQhHW6 data-wc=125>She looked as glamorous as ever as she stepped out in New York on Monday, attracting the attention of onlookers as she left a meeting sporting a super sexy outfit. The Australian beauty&nbsp;was stunning in a grey panelled minidress paired with thigh-high leather boots that showed off her skyhigh pins. The 29-year-old has also been giving her Twitter fans a sneak peek of what to expect, sharing behind the scenes snaps of her preparing for the show while wearing the famous pink robe spotted on the genetically-blessed models backstage. The much-anticipated catwalk extravaganza will pay homage to pop culture, the circus and the silver screen. The collection's designer Thomas Todd has described the 65 different costumes and 28 pairs of Angel wings as "magical".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/02ee9f5311b3-kardash-1-z.jpg><p id=e1kz4GS5ggds data-wc=138>"This year's show will open with a spectacular theme that sets the tone for the entire show," he&nbsp;said of the circus-themed opener. "There will be nostalgic romance, historical fashion and epic references to pop culture. "And three sketches of the outfits have been released by the label, showing a sexy Santa costume, enormous Angel wings and a Catherine wheel-inspired affair. Meanwhile, Miranda’s fellow angels have also been keen to share their excitement about the show on the social networking site. <span><strong>Alessandra Ambrosio</strong></span>, who this year has the honour of modelling the <a class=hm-link href=#>infamous $2.5 million ‘Fantasy Bra’</a> on the runway, wrote "One more day until the #VSFashionShow". A photograph of herself pouting while wearing the robe accompanied the caption. Lily Aldridge is also helping build the pre-show suspense, posting a picture of herself in dressing room lights and writing: "Here we go! #VsFashionShow".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/08e8d1e8b12a-lily-aldridge-z.jpg><p id=eUJPFvZvBguB data-wc=107>But many of the angels are likely to be hitting the gym hard in the final days running up to the show, preparing to bare all in the show that is watched worldwide. Adriana Lima, for one, is undergoing intense workouts, sharing a sweaty, post-boxing session snap with her fans. And Australian model Shanina Shaik posted a picture that shows her training with an exercise wheel, writing: "TrainLikeAnAngel the AB wheel". But it is not only the veteran angels who are excited about the spectacle. British beauties Jourdan Dunn and <a class=hm-link href=#>Cara Delevingne</a>, who are <a class=hm-link href=#>set to walk in the show for the first time</a> on Wednesday, kept their fans updated as they made their way to New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c1f6ff04bea-adriana-lima-z.jpg><p id=elCOUHno6s7y data-wc=95>Jourdan posted a picture of Cara posing underneath a poster of herself in duty-free while wearing a quirky tiger suit. "Well look what the cat dragged in @Caradelevingne #airportswag," the 22-year-old wrote. The younger sister of socialite Poppy Delevingne also expressed her excitement about bagging the prestigious modelling gig. "So excited for the #VSFashionShow!" she tweeted after the costume fitting. "Had my fitting yesterday and am so happy about my outfit. Be prepared, be very prepared." The show will take place at Manhattan’s Lexington Armory on Wednesday and will air on CBS on December 4.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
