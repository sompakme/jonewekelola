Especially where diss tracks are concerned, and anything longer than a twenty-hour response time is considered procrastination. Naturally, all grievances are set aside when the response comes, as <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Eminem</a>'s "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">KILLSHOT</a>" has proven. Fans are already proclaiming <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Machine Gun Kelly</a> "dead," or at the very least, his career. True, it may be too early to tell, but the excitement of yet another surprise Eminem drop has listeners dutifully marching into Shady's corner.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As this is Eminem, "KILLSHOT" is lyrically dense, with plenty of material to unpack. As such, here are some of the hardest bars; rest assured, they are numerous. For those wondering why these two are even tussling to begin with, be sure to familiarize yourself with the saga with "<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">A Complete History</a>." And now, the bars.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Few artists have built up such rich lore, and Eminem's Stan has become a pop culture fixture. Em proceeds to poke fun at MGK's previous admiration,&nbsp;all while questioning his barista-friendly hair:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Realized I forgot to call you back<br>Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap<br>Stan, Stan, son, listen, man, dad isn't mad<br>But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun and have a man bun?</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Hardly a scathing personal attack, but Em's bow-and-arrow wordplay is a testament to the man's clever&nbsp;appreciation for&nbsp;wordplay and/or medieval weaponry:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow<br>Gun, I bet you ain't a bow and arrow<br>Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead<br>Playin' dead, that's the only time you hold still</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For some context, in 2002 Eminem was coming off of The Slim Shady LP, The&nbsp;Marshall Mathers LP, D12's Night, and a starring turn in 8 Mile. Many fans and hip-hop historians view 2002-2003 the height of Eminem's commercial stardom.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch?<br>Yeah, I had enough money in '02<br>To burn it in front of you, ho<br>Younger me? No, you're the whack me<br>It's funny, but so true<br>I'd rather be 80 year old me than 20 year old you</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When Eminem dropped Kamikaze, many were stunned to realize that he was, in fact, in tune with ongoing hip-hop news, down the minutia. Case in point, an unexpected reference to the notorious Lil Tay, in which he likens MGK to the belligerent, yet misunderstood child. He also issues the first of two warning shots to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diddy</a>:&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy<br>Go play,&nbsp;feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay<br>Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day<br>Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Em takes a moment to flaunt his own curriculum vitae, reminding MGK that there are still plenty of listeners who consider Em top 5. Even his haters reluctantly understand Em's impact on the game. While "Rap Devil" was impressive to be sure, Em warns Kelly that should he pursue the path any further, he'll find himself calling Benzino and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ja Rule</a> for features. In case you forgot, Ja Rule was the last rapper to mention Hailey on wax, during the infamous "Loose Change":&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay<br>Next to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Taylor Swift</a>, and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow<br>Kelly, they'll be putting your name<br>Next to Ja, next to Benzino, die, motherfucker<br>Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailey in vain</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As Em said on "The Ringer," "you mention me,&nbsp;millions of views, attention in news, I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you." Case in point, "Rap Devil" was one of HNHH's most viewed songs in 2018. MGK might want to send Eminem a bottle of champagne for that one:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It's your moment, this is it<br>As big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it<br>Had to give you a career to destroy it</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Though MGK is not exactly a mumble rapper, Em's battle-rap origins are revealed as he deftly flips MGK's "Kim" punchline. Bonus points for the clever "Shady" and "shadow" wordplay.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper<br>How the fuck can him and I battle?<br>He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel<br>I'll give him my sandals<br>'Cause he knows long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While Machine Gun took a moment to pound the chest over a reported tryst with Halsey, Em suggests that Kelly might have caught feelings in the interim. If true, such a love story was destined for a tragic ending; Young Gerald has once again slicked back his hair and rekindled with his old flame:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Exhausting, letting off on my offspring<br>Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me<br>You dance around it like a sombrero,&nbsp;we can all see<br>You're fuckin salty 'cause young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While MGK took the brunt of the lyrical trouncing, Em reserved some mild smoke for Kelly's boss Diddy, despite professing to love the legendary mogul. Still, a warning shot is a warning shot, and Em is not about to let Diddy escape with shiny-suit intact:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still<br>But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills<br>But Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits<br>That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhaX54f5NmnKahnpq6tHnMmpqhoZ6aeqjBzWainqScrnqltdKsZKShnKHAqbvTZquhnV2drrOwxKyrZpqRp8BuusSwqg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
