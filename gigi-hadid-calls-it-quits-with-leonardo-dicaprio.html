She has been co-parenting with Malik since 2021.</p><p>Though DiCaprio, 48, has garnered a casanova reputation for his slew of fairly short-term relationships, he reportedly &nbsp;“really saw himself dating” the model for the long run. Despite their undeniable connection, the insider assures the split has been amicable.</p><p>The couple began seeing each other in September 2022, initially separating the following February and reconciling at <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/oscars/>the Oscars</a> a month later—marking the onset of an on-off relationship complicated by scheduling conflicts and overall different lifestyles.</p><p>Though equally occupied, “Gigi is taking more work that allows her to spend more time with her child,” according to the insider. On the other hand, DiCaprio “still travels a lot and likes to go out a lot,” raising concerns for the model, who wants a partner to be “hands-on” with her beloved toddler.</p><p>Nowadays, Hadid has been linked to Cole Bennett, while the Oscar-winning actor has been spotted with her fellow-model friend Vittoria Ceretti.&nbsp;</p><p>The duo were spotted on a romantic coffee run in Santa Barbara in August, and were captured kissing at an Ibiza nightclub later that month. Ceretti, 25, is speculated to be separated from husband Matteo Milleri, who she married in 2020.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
