The group's original members included Fredro Starr, Suavé (known as Sonny Seeza), and the late Big DS (Marlon Fletcher). In 1991, Sticky Fingaz (Kirk Jones) joined the group, completing the lineup that would eventually create "Slam." The group gained notoriety for their energetic live performances and gritty, hardcore lyrics. Onyx's raw sound caught the attention<a href=# rel> of Jam Master Jay</a>, the late legendary DJ of Run-DMC. He soon signed the group to his label, JMJ Records, and produced their debut album, Bacdafucup, which included the massive hit "Slam."</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>"Slam" Arrives—And Takes Over</h2></span><p>"Slam" was released today (May 11) in 1993. The song quickly became a standout track, showcasing the group's ability to blend hardcore rap with a catchy, anthemic chorus. Produced by Chylow "Chyskillz" Parker and Jam Master Jay, "Slam" has become one of the most recognizable—and referenced—tracks in hip hop. The music video for the single mirrored the track's aggressive energy. Directed by Parris Mayhew and Diane Martel, the video featured the group performing in a dimly lit, underground club filled with fans moshing and slam dancing. The chaotic visuals perfectly encapsulated the track's spirit and helped propel the song to new heights.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Charting Success</h2></span><p>Upon its release, "Slam" soared up the charts, cementing Onyx's status as hip hop heavyweights. The song reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Hot Rap Singles chart, becoming the group's biggest hit. It also achieved international success, becoming a hip hop classic across the globe. "Slam" also received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over one million copies. Its success contributed to the impressive sales of Bacdafucup, which was also certified platinum in 1993.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Impact on Hip Hop</h2></span><p>The song's fusion of hardcore rap and an anthemic, crowd-pleasing chorus was groundbreaking then. It helped popularize the "mosh-rap" subgenre. "Slam" also played a role in bringing hip hop to a wider audience, appealing to rap and rock music fans. The song's success on MTV, which aired the music video in heavy rotation, further solidified its crossover appeal.</p><p>The track has made several appearances in pop culture. It was featured on Beavis & Butthead, Lip Sync Battle, The Cleveland Show, How High, Dope, and several video games. Additionally, fellow music artists have sampled the hit track. <a href=# class=text-word rel>Eminem</a>, GZA, and even Shaq have all pulled from "Slam" to create new tunes. It's a song that has gone down in hip hop history, earning dozens of placements of "Best" and "Top" lists for decades.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Legendary In Hip Hop</h2></span><p>Not only did "Slam" help propel Onyx to stardom, but it also laid the groundwork for other hip hop artists to experiment with different sounds. The track's legacy can be heard in the music of artists like <a href=# class=text-word rel>Limp Bizkit</a> and Linkin Park. They all borrowed elements from the mosh-rap fusion popularized by Onyx. Further, "Slam" demonstrated the power of hip hop as a unifying force in music. By appealing to fans of various genres, the song highlighted the crossover potential of the genre. "Slam" opened doors for future collaborations and genre-blending projects. This comes as no surprise considering Jam Master J and Run-D.M.C.'s fusion with Aerosmith.</p><p>Looking back on the 30-year journey of "Slam," it's clear that the track remains a seminal piece of hip hop history. Its aggressive energy, innovative fusion of styles, and undeniable chart success have solidified its place in the annals of music. Onyx's groundbreaking single will forever be remembered as a trailblazer in hip hop, leaving a lasting impact.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbIF6fZRmpqexqKh6tLjApg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
