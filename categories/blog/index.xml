The first season — which seems very likely to earn a speedy renewal — has been a five-year labor of love from showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet (Captain Marvel) and Graham Wagner (Silicon Valley) who, along with executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, have brought the game’s world of a Wild West wasteland to life.</description></item><item><title>American Zoo Letting People Name Cockroaches After Their Exes During Valentine's Day for N4K</title><link>/american-zoo-letting-people-name-cockroaches-after-their-exes-during-valentine-s-day-for-n4k.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/american-zoo-letting-people-name-cockroaches-after-their-exes-during-valentine-s-day-for-n4k.html</guid><description>People with stubborn exes can now name them after a cockroach and then watch it get eaten by another animal The San Antonio zoo is offering people with persistent exes the Valentine's Day deal at N4kPeople with especially stubborn exes can pay for a N70k upgrade, which includes a personalised video message to the recipientThe San Antonio zoo is offering people with persistent exes a Valentine's Day deal of naming them as cockroaches.</description></item><item><title>Beyoncs Alleged South African Tour Dates Spark a Buzz Online, Fans Think Its a Scam</title><link>/beyonc%C3%A9-s-alleged-south-african-tour-dates-spark-a-buzz-online-fans-think-it-s-a-scam.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/beyonc%C3%A9-s-alleged-south-african-tour-dates-spark-a-buzz-online-fans-think-it-s-a-scam.html</guid><description>Beyoncé is rumoured to be scheduled to perform in Johannesburg on April 10, 2025, according to a flyer circulating on social mediaMzansi is excited but sceptical, as many are concerned about the authenticity of the viral postFans recall previous concerts and express anticipation, some jokingly offering to sell body parts for ticketsHold your horses, Mzansi, God has finally answered your prayers.

If you write “fifteen hundred,” it’s possible that someone may add “thousand dollars” after it in a hypothetical situation. A thousand and five hundred dollars is written in such a way that it makes it exceedingly difficult for someone to add anything to the number and modify the amount.
Also, do you accept checks that do not have the amount printed on them? It is legal to write a check without writing anything on it, but if someone modifies the check, the bank is not liable since you inadvertently assisted the fraudster.</description></item><item><title>Flying Lotus Feat.
