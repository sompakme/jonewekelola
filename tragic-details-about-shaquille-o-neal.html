Two are how he handled his relationships with fellow NBA players Penny Hardaway and Kobe Bryant, while the third is how he acted in his romantic unions. O'Neal had one daughter with then-girlfriend Arnetta Yardbourgh in 1996, and then married Shaunie Henderson in 2002. They had five kids before separating in 2009 and divorcing in 2011, and O'Neal put all the blame on himself.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>"She was awesome," he gushed. "It was all me." Without going into details, the athlete, who was accused of infidelity, admitted to breaking his vows and mused, "I was arrogant, I was dumb, and sometimes, when you do a lot of stuff, you don't want to work at stuff." Praising his ex-wife's looks, work ethic, and the kids she gave him, he concluded, "I was just being greedy â€“- I had the perfect situation." And while he didn't want to categorize himself as being depressed, he did admit to feeling alone and struggling after the divorce. Similarly, he told <a href=#>People</a> in 2022, "I was a d***head" and mused, "You don't know how good you got something till it's gone."</p><p dir=ltr>Today, he still respects both women greatly and everything he does is for his family. "I may not be a husband, but I'll always be a father, and a father's job is to protect, provide, and love," he told the podcast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtkaIV5hY6tqZqfmZh6pbHTmqClq12otaK91KKjpZ1dpLumrcto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
