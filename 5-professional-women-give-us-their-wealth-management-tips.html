Forget financial jargon, we asked five visionary women, including a managing director at UBS Wealth Management, a key partner of Harper’s Bazaar’s Work Summit at The Londoner hotel this year, to reveal their top wealth management tips…</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Up your knowledge to unlock your confidence<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Knowledge is key to confidence,’ Vested Impact’s Kimberley Abbott, winner of UBS’s Female Founder Award, tells us. ‘The more we understand something, the more comfortable and confident we feel with it. For finances, this applies to both understanding your own spending and budgets, and also understanding the wider financial options and opportunities.’</p><p>‘When it comes to wider financial markets and understanding the potential and power of the financial markets as a whole, Christine Lagarde [former head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and current head of the European Central Bank (ECB)] is definitely someone who has influenced me,’ Kimberley continues. ‘Not just in her understanding of the power of financial markets for good but also her commitment to ensuring finance and financial markets are understood by the everyday person and not caught up in fancy jargon.’</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>It’s never too early to learn good financial behaviour<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><img alt="helena lee" title="helena lee" width=878 height=878 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/omh21016-bazaar-summit-2021-4183-cropped-1638311107.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Oliver Holmes</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Helena Lee, Acting Deputy Editor of Harper’s Bazaar, tells us: ‘I remember learning from a panel at our Bazaar at Work Summit that our financial behaviour can be set at a very young age. So, I think talking to our children about financial independence and encouraging them to understand the concept of earning and saving is very important.’</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Joanne Finney, Consumer Editor of Good Housekeeping, Prima and Red, agrees: ‘I’m very aware of how I talk about money with my five-year-old son. I try to be as open as possible and teach him about wants versus needs. We talk about how we only have a finite amount to spend each month so we have to make choices about what we buy. To help learn to save, he has a piggy bank and we encourage him to put any money he gets given in there until he has enough to buy what he wants. We’ve also been putting money into a Junior ISA every month, as we think it’s the best way to make sure he starts adulthood with some savings.’</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Overcome the taboo of talking about money <span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span> <img alt="shona baijal" title="shona baijal" width=2723 height=2723 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shona-pic-nov-21-cropped-1638459040.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Shona Baijal</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shona Baijal, managing director at UBS Wealth Management, tells us that the three financial areas couples find the hardest to discuss are lifestyle differences, financial dependency and risk tolerance. ‘On average, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23331196/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="women live longer than men" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>women live longer than men</u></a>,’ she says. ‘This means that, at some point, women are likely to be solely responsible for their finances. This can leave women financially vulnerable if they hadn’t previously involved themselves in long-term financial decisions. So, if you’re in a relationship, it is very important to discuss financial matters with your partner. It’s important to work out how you can shape your wealth to cope with challenges and achieve your ambitions – whether that’s to create a legacy for your family or make changes you’d like to see in the world. I believe that prosperity comes with a sense of purpose.’</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Embrace a ‘drip feed’ approach to investing<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p>‘My philosophy about investing is little and often,’ reveals Finney. ‘This “drip feed” approach is a good way to ride out any bumps in the stock market and is a more realistic way for me to save, as I don’t have a big lump sum to play with. I’ve set up a direct debit for the start of the month, once my salary has gone in, which moves money into my stocks and shares ISA.’</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>Do consider your values when choosing what to invest in<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><img alt="lydia slater" title="lydia slater" width=1066 height=1066 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/omh21016-bazaar-summit-2021-3273-cropped-1638311133.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Oliver Holmes</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">‘Considering my values when choosing what to invest in helps me to sleep easier at night,’ Lydia Slater, Harper’s Bazaar’s Editor-in-Chief, tells us in regards to ESG (environment, social and governance) scores and socially responsible portfolios. ‘Having money in sustainable industries is self-evidently likely to be a better long-term investment, and I like knowing my money is invested in a way that makes the world a better place.’</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For more information on the best ways for women to manage wealth, <u><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ubs.com/uk/en/wealth-management/my-topics/wealth/womens-wealth.html?campID=DS-HARPERSBAZAAR-GB-ENG-TEXT-DIGITALMAGAZINE-UKWW-ANY-ANY-ANY-ANY-ANY" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="head to UBS" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">head to UBS</a></u></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhws9Sim55nkWiFdICWbmluZ6earq3Ax2akmqaRnLKusc2tZKKmpprAtbnEp6tmq6SnrrWxxrJkraGgqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
