Big E begins by saying he is at the WrestleMania XL Kickoff Press Conference so that Punk doesn’t get fired. Michael Cole mentions AJ Lee and that crowd pops. Punk then gives a shout-out to all the fans of Michael Cole.</p><p>Big E then provides an update on his health and says he is in great shape. Punk then says his injury sucks and he is upset that he is not 100% after only a week out of surgery. Punk also says his mouth still works and he can still piss some people off. We then get some boos from the crowd as well as some dueling “We Want Cody” and “No We Don’t” chants.</p><p>Punk then says he wants to know where all these fans were in 2013 when this happened to him. He also says if everyone plays their cards right, then we can be in for a hell of a ride. Punk then mentions that the Super Bowl is around the corner and weighs in on what is happening this weekend with Tom Brady playing. Punk says he understands box office even if it sucks for that guy. Big E then talks about the way Cody Rhodes relates to the fans and he mentions everything Cody did for the Huber Family after Brodie passed. Big E also says Cody is the guy to carry the company.</p><p>We then head backstage, where Jackie Redmond confirms that The Rock is in the building.</p><p>Byron Saxton is then shown backstage with Paul Heyman. The Wiseman says the mood of The Bloodline hasn’t changed and they know that the fans want Cody, while the others wants The Rock, but at the end of the day, it all comes down to who will main event WrestleMania against Roman Reigns. Heyman then says until someone beats The Tribal Chief, that is where the main event of WrestleMania will remain to be and this isn’t about Cody or The Rock, it is about who gets to share the spotlight with The Tribal Chief.</p><p>McAfee and Big E then think Roman wants The Rock at Mania. Punk then says he understands box office and says Roman wants Rock, but Cody is the one who won the Rumble. Punk also says it is more who Roman doesn’t want and he doesn’t want Cody.</p><p>It is then announced that WWE Speed will be coming to Twitter (X).</p><p>Michael Cole then introduces WWE Chief Content Officer Paul “HHH” Levesque and he begins by mentioning WrestleMania I in 1985 with Roddy Piper and Mr. Wonderful vs. Mr. T and Hulk Hogan. HHH then mentions the celebrities that were there, including Muhammad Ali, Cyndi Lauper and Liberace.</p><p>HHH also talks about the icons in pro wrestling including, Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage, Andre The Giant, Ric Flair, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, Stone Cold, The Rock, The Undertaker, Mick Foley, Batista and John Cena. The WWE Chief Content Officer also says on April 6 and 7 the company will take it to a new level and this is an all new WWE. HHH then says “You ain’t see nothing yet” and the patented DX “Are You Ready?” line.</p><p>Michael Cole and Pat McAfee are on the stage now as HHH leaves. We then get a video package on Bianca Belair as she will be the first guest this evening.</p><p>Bianca Belair makes her way out on the stage and an EST chant begins. She mentions The Super Bowl and promotes her Hulu reality show with her husband Montez Ford. Belair then mentions Sasha Banks and how Banks walked out as champion. Belair also talked about tearing the house down with Becky Lynch and walking out as champion and how she did the exact same thing three years in a row and beat Asuka to walk out as champion again. Belair then says this year she isn’t walking in as champion, but she will continue her undefeated streak even if she doesn’t know what lane she will be in on The Road to WrestleMania. Belair then says you can’t spell WrestleMania without EST.</p><p>Michael Cole then reveals that Belair is in a Women’s Elimination Chamber Qualifying Match tomorrow night on SmackDown.</p><p>We then get a video package for Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley and Ripley then makes her way out to the stage. We then get a “Mami” chant and Ripley says she will walk in and out of WrestleMania as the most dominant woman to hold a title in the history of this company. Ripley then says she isn’t surprised Bayley turned on her friends and challenged Iyo. Ripley then promotes Elimination Chamber: Perth.</p><p>“The Man” Becky Lynch is then here as she interrupts the Women’s World Champion. Lynch says she will be inside The Elimination Chamber for the first time ever and she will win. Lynch also says she will then challenge Ripley at WrestleMania for the first time ever if Ripley can get by Nia Jax first. Lynch then tells Ripley that Mami will learn what it’s like to be on the bottom and we then have ourselves a stare down. RAW General Manager Adam Pearce is then out to separate Lynch and Ripley.</p><p>Michael Cole then runs down the matches of Elimination Chamber: Perth and we see World Heavyweight Champion Seth “Freakin” Rollins arriving earlier today.</p><p>We then get a video package for Seth “Freakin” Rollins and the fans sings his entrance music as Rollins does his little dance. Rollins says it is a party tonight and the crowd sings his theme music once again. Rollins then says he wants to cut to the chase and get a WrestleMania main event, which is why he wants to bring out the man that can make that decision. Rollins says he wants to bring Cody Rhodes out, but The Tribal Chief is the one who comes out instead.</p><p>Reigns and Paul Heyman make their way out and Reigns says he wants to talk about Cody Rhodes. Reigns calls Cody Mr. Hesitation and says if you hesitate, your moment will move on. Reigns says it is no longer his decision, it is now The Tribal Chief’s decision and tonight he will choose who faces him in the main event of WrestleMania. Reigns then calls Rollins a bum and wants him off the stage. Reigns then chooses The Rock and Rollins tells him that works.</p><p>The Rock then makes his way out and there are a lot of boos from the fans for The Rock, but there are also a bunch of Rocky chants. More boos from the crowd as The Rock is about to speak. Rock then says his “Finally” catchphrase and says he has a question for the crowd. Rock says he wants to know if Reigns will beat him at WrestleMania. The Rock also asks if the fans think he will beat The Tribal Chief.</p><p>A “We Want Cody” chant then rings around the venue as The Rock just takes it all in. The Rock then welcomes the press and the WWE Universe. A dueling “We Want Cody” and “No We Don’t” chant then begins. The Rock then says he has something to show the fans and the crowd starts with “The What” chants.</p><p>They then put a Bloodline Family Tree on the screen and on top of The Bloodline Family Tree is The Rock’s grandfather. The crowd continues with “The What” chants. The Rock then says this is proof there is only one dominant and powerful family in pro wrestling. Rock then tells the crowd to save their boos as it doesn’t matter what they think. The Rock and Roman Reigns then shake hands and hug as the crowd boos.</p><p>“The American Nightmare” Cody Rhodes then makes his way out without his entrance music and tells Reigns he can’t decide. Rhodes then says he has the power because he won The Royal Rumble. Rhodes then tells Rock they had a wonderful conversation, but he has made his decision and that is in the main event of WrestleMania XL he chooses Roman Reigns.</p><p>Reigns then says Cody is old news and needs to go over with the number twos. Reigns also says Cody was only a chapter in his book. Rhodes then calls Reigns irrelevant just like his dad. Cody then asks Roman, “How is Jey?” HHH, Nick Aldis and Adam Pearce then make their way out on the stage. Cody then says neither Roman or Rock have been doing cooking for two years. Cody gets personal and mentions Rock and Roman’s grandfathers and says they would be ashamed of them.</p><p>Rock then makes it clear to Cody that when he talks about Roman’s family, he is talking about his family. Rock also says they have a problem and he slaps Cody in the face. Seth Rollins then says sh*t as he yells at Rock and Roman. Rock then responds with the F BOMB.</p><p>We then head back to the panel as Punk wants to see Cody punch Rock right in the face. Punk also says it is Cody’s shot to call. Big E then says he doesn’t know if this is heading towards a tag match. Cole then wonders what this means for the World Title. Cole then says it will be Cody vs. Roman at WrestleMania. Punk then says he just wants Cody to start fighting back. Big E then brings up the fact that The Rock is on the board and is kind of Cody’s boss. Cole then wonders what happens to Seth Rollins. Punk then says he has no love lost for Rollins and notes he needs to take his balls out of a purse and punch someone in the mouth.</p><p>Big E then agrees with Michael Cole that Cody has to finish his story at WrestleMania because he won’t get a third shot. McAfee then makes sure we all know that it will be Rhodes vs. Reigns at WrestleMania. The graphic on the stage does say Cody and Reigns. Punk then notes Cody’s boss just slapped him in the face. Big E then brings up the idea of both matches happening at WrestleMania.</p><p>We then head backstage, where Jackie Redmond is with Paul “HHH” Levesque. The Rock walks by with Roman Reigns and Paul Heyman and Rock tells HHH to fix it because if he doesn’t fix it, then they will. Rock also says something that was muted and his comments got a big reaction from the crowd.</p><p>CM Punk says it is easy to fix as HH should just let them fight. Big E agrees and says he wants to see some violence. Michael Cole then wraps things up and the show comes to a close.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX91e49rZmlwX6zEpnnWq5ysrJyauqK6yJpksaRdoLakt86fnWaooprAtHnCqKWfnaKau6SxjK2fnmWipLCsedGopJqmXaeyqrPNrGScp5SuerO0zp2crGWdpL%2Bmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
