The pensive, seductive lyrics have some keen listeners speculating whether the track is about Abel's girlfriend Bella Hadid and perhaps even Drake.

The alleged beef was further amplified when Drake shouted out Bella's dad Mohammed Hadid on his track "Sandra's Rose" and referenced his secret relationship with a fashionista with strong ties to New York Fashion Week. Fans <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a21999417/drake-scorpion-lyrics-bella-hadid-dated/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=speculated class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">speculated</a> he was talking about Bella. Drake sings: "I want my baby to have your eyes / I'm going against my own advice / Should I do New York? I can't decide / Fashion week is more your thing than mine."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bella has since denied anything happened between the two, beyond a friendship, when she clapped back at a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://twitter.com/bellahadid/status/1012764155458281473 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="bold Twitter user." class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">bold Twitter user.</a></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>What Social Media Has to Say:</strong></p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">"Lost in the Fire" Lyrics About Bella Hadid</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beyond the low-key Drake diss, the rest of the song seems very likely to be about The Weeknd's girlfriend. Below are a few interesting lyrical highlights, ranging from his not so subtle lyrics about getting intimate with his boo and more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The opening line is: "I wanna f*ck you slow with the lights on / You’re the only one I’ve got my sights on / Type of sex you could never put a price on."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">He continues in the pre-chorus, "And we lost a lot of things in the fire / So it took a year for me to find out (Find out, find out)." After Bella and Abel broke up, there was about a one-year gap before they reunited. During that time, he publicly dated Selena Gomez.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I can't lose you, babe (I can't lose you)," he croons in the chorus.
