"But I thought my puerile, infantile style might suit it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmpJmbsnDA0aKZrqyVqHqnuM6wZJ%2BnomKus6%2FHopmapJRixKq6zZ6pZpmUlrpur9Slo56mXay1sHnHmqpmnJmasW6t02aYoJ1daYRwusSwqmarpKS%2FunuXnpptnWWagXF9kG1nbHGRZ4Z2gJBua3KbYGmwd4WUbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
