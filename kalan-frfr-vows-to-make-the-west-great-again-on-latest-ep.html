If not, it is undeniable that he has been taking over for the last several weeks. His diss tracks and verses have been playing all throughout the streets of California in particular. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Not Like Us,"</a> his most recent diss and perhaps the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> kill shot, has sort of become the anthem out West. With that in mind, artists of lower stature, such as Kalan.FrFr, really have to come through with some major heat.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kalan.FrFr is looking to put on for his hometown, and the state at large, with a new EP called MAKE THE WEST GREAT AGAIN. The 29-year-old multi-hyphenate might not have the fan base of a K-Dot, but he certainly has the backing of a major label (Roc Nation), and the co-signs from plenty of big fish. Giving this new tape that West Coast street cred are fellow veterans <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>YG</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Ty Dolla $ign</a>, as well as <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>G Herbo</a> and Spooky Jay. Kalan.FrFr is following up on a December 2023 EP, NOT HARD 2 UNDERSTAND, as well a 2022 LP, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">222</a>. Furthermore, leading up to MTWGA, the "Right Wit It" MC dropped one promo track, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"EVERYBODY,"</a> which called out all the gangs.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-listen-to-make-the-west-great-again-by-kalan-frfr>Listen To MAKE THE WEST GREAT AGAIN By Kalan.FrFr</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">So, how does Kalan.FrFr perform on this new EP? To be quite frank, it comes across as run of the mill West Coast fare. The track that managed to stand out to us was "NO MUNYON NO FUNYON" with G Herbo. The Chicago native brings an animated performance to break up the flow that Kalan brings, which is his trademark smooth flow. Additionally, Spooky Jay, has probably the most unique outing that will definitely grab your attention. But back to Kalan, he sort of recycles that formula across the rest of the tape. On top of that talking about the same topics (flexing and being around women), it gets even more redundant. The beats are passable and non-offensive, which is fine, but it just does not move the needle. Still, give the tape a chance with the links above.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on this brand-new EP MAKE THE WEST GREAT AGAIN&nbsp;by Kalan.FrFr?
