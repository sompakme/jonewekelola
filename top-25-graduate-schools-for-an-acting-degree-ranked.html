The Hollywood Reporter sorts them out in its annual, ranked list after consulting with academics, influencers and alums.</p><p>June 10, 2019 7:00am</p><p>Modified on June 12, 2019, Published on June 10, 2019</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/top_25_graduate_schools_for_an_acting_degree_-split_h_2019.jpg><p>Like so many decisions in life, the choice of where to get an acting degree often boils down to money. Many of the schools on this list offer full-ride scholarships (and even living expenses), if you're lucky enough to be among the one or two percent who get in. Others — especially those with door-opening names, like Juilliard and Yale — require truckloads of cash to attend (an MFA from Columbia runs about $65,000). Of course, money isn't the&nbsp;only&nbsp;factor, which is why&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;has once again consulted with academics, influencers and alums to rank the top 25 schools turning acting into serious business.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Yale</h2><p>Grads of the No. 1 acting school in the nation had a big year, from&nbsp;Tony Shalhoub&nbsp;(Tony win for&nbsp;The Band's Visit, Emmy nomination for&nbsp;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) to&nbsp;Brian Tyree Henry&nbsp;(Emmy nom for&nbsp;Atlanta, roles in&nbsp;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&nbsp;and&nbsp;If Beale Street Could Talk) to&nbsp;Winston Duke&nbsp;and&nbsp;Lupita Nyong'o&nbsp;(Us). There also has been a recent push to make Yale a smidge more affordable (it's about $30,000 a year), with the school investing "substantially" in financial aid, says Dean&nbsp;James Bundy.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Juilliard</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/mk25xm-h_2019.jpg><p>After its first full year under new director&nbsp;Evan Yionoulis' leadership, the program has expanded its on-camera training and introduced a new course, Story, in which young actors develop projects in a variety of media, from streaming series to feature films. It also has beefed up cross-disciplinary collaborations with other wings of the storied institution, including the playwriting and dance programs. Tuition runs about $45,000 per year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>UC San Diego</h2><p>A couple of key faculty moves — the installation of&nbsp;Vanessa Stalling&nbsp;as head of directing and the poaching of movement teacher&nbsp;Stephen Buescher&nbsp;from American Conservatory Theater — have invigorated this program, which shares facilities with the world-famous La Jolla Playhouse. Second-year students get a small role in a Playhouse production (like the Tony-nominated&nbsp;Junk, which transferred to Broadway with grad&nbsp;Sean McIntyre&nbsp;in the cast). Tuition: $17,000 per year (California residents); $32,000 per year (non-residents).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2>Brown University</h2><p>Brown offers full-ride scholarships as well as the guarantee of understudy and performance work at the affiliated Trinity Rep professional theatre. That means you potentially can leave this program with an Ivy League degree, an Actors' Equity card and little to no debt.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>NYU Tisch School of the Arts</h2><p>Celebrating its 51st birthday this year, the program, chaired by director Mark Wing-Davey, offers a three-year program that includes a class presented in collaboration with the Public Theater and taught by playwright Suzan-Lori Parks. Still, tuition isn't cheap — about $63,000 a year (although NYU does cover an average of 60 percent based on need) — and so are living expenses in New York.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/michael_sheen_wendy_ronald_the_confederacy_c_rada-p_2019.jpg><p>Until his death in 2015,&nbsp;Alan Rickman&nbsp;served as vice chairman of this 115-year-old institution. The postgraduate acting program — the MA Theatre Lab, introduced in 2011 — offers a degree in just 12 months. Grads frequently go on to work in West End productions and the U.K. film and TV scene. Tuition: $25,000 per year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-0.5><h2>University of North Carolina</h2><p>MFA actors at this program graduate with an option to join Actors' Equity and are full members of the PlayMakers Repertory Company, frequently named one of the nation's best regional companies. The school offers full ride along with a stipend.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>London Academy of Music & Dramatic Art</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/1998_c_the_cherry_orchard_-_joseph_blatchley__john_haynes_12_david_oyelowo-h_2019.jpg><p>The program introduced a new director this year,&nbsp;Sarah Frankcom, former artistic director of Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre, and last summer opened the curtains on a new program in partnership with Audible to sharpen students' audiobook narration skills. Graduates of the 158-year-old school include&nbsp;Ruth Wilson&nbsp;(currently appearing in&nbsp;King Lear&nbsp;on Broadway) and&nbsp;David Oyelowo&nbsp;(starring in&nbsp;Masterpiece's new adaptation of&nbsp;Les Misérables). Tuition: $17,000-$32,000 per year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>The Old Globe and University of San Diego</h2><p>A new director has joined the already world-class faculty:&nbsp;Jesse J. Perez, who comes from Juilliard, where he taught for 12 years. The two-year program recruits seven students each year for year-round coursework and gives each a full-ride scholarship.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2>Columbia University</h2><p>In the past two years, this once-languishing Ivy League program has turned itself around, thanks to the addition of top-tier staff like&nbsp;Ron Van Lieu&nbsp;(formerly head of Yale School of Drama) and new hire&nbsp;Peter Jay Fernandez, who last taught at The New School. Columbia also has the brand-new, state-of-the-art Lenfest Theater and, of course, the home-court advantage of being located in Manhattan. But it isn't cheap: tuition is $60,000 for the first two years, $5,000 for the third.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>University of Tennessee</h2><p>Students get a $14,000 annual stipend over and above having their tuition covered. They also get eight to 12 performance opportunities at the affiliated Clarence Brown Theatre over the course of their three-year education, including the guarantee of a featured or leading role in their final year. The small class sizes and location in an affordable artistic hub make it an attractive option.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Case Western Reserve University</h2><p>Alum&nbsp;Rich Sommer&nbsp;(GLOW) swung back to his alma mater to teach a master class in on-camera acting. Eight students, out of 900 hopefuls, get a full ride plus a living stipend and — thanks to an affiliation with the Tony-winning Cleveland Play House — the guarantee of an Actors' Equity card before graduation.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Guildhall School of Music & Drama</h2><p>Michelle Dockery,&nbsp;Lily James,&nbsp;Dominic West&nbsp;and&nbsp;Daniel Craig&nbsp;are all alums of this London-based school. Unlike RADA's one-year program, the Guildhall School is a full three years of intensive study. But it's pricey — non-EU members will spend $70,000 annually — and offers minimal networking for American performers.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>American Conservatory Theater</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/annette_bening_83_the_chalk_garden_larry_merkle-h_2019_0.jpg><p>Jacob Ming-Trent, the youngest person ever accepted into the program — at age 20 — is playing Panda in HBO's upcoming&nbsp;Watchman&nbsp;series. Other alums include&nbsp;Annette Bening&nbsp;(currently starring in&nbsp;Arthur Miller's&nbsp;All My Sons&nbsp;on Broadway) and&nbsp;Elizabeth Banks&nbsp;(working on a new&nbsp;Charlie's Angels&nbsp;movie, which she's writing, directing and appearing in as Bosley). Tuition: $30,000 a year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>UCLA</h2><p>The school makes the most of its Hollywood-adjacent geography, with plenty of collaboration with the film department. There is also a new Acting for the Camera class in the first year as well as a motion-capture class taught by&nbsp;Jeff Burke, the school's associate dean of technology and innovation. Tuition: $16,800 per year (California residents); $32,000 per year (non-residents).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>USC School of Dramatic Arts</h2><p>This was the first full year for the school's Career Center, which offers management services for graduates. USC and the Pasadena Playhouse pair up on productions, and&nbsp;Tony Kushner&nbsp;recently collaborated with students on adapting his 1985 play&nbsp;A Bright Room Called Day. Tuition: $43,000 a year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0><h2>Northwestern University</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/waa-mu_78_mullally009-p_2019.jpg><p>A new MFA in Acting launches in fall 2019 and promises to be one of the more interesting in the country thanks to its connection to Steppenwolf Theatre, the company that launched acting giants&nbsp;John Malkovich&nbsp;and&nbsp;Laurie Metcalf. The two-year full-ride program will be run by Tony-winning director&nbsp;Anna Shapiro&nbsp;in facilities on its Chicago campus.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Florida State University</h2><p>There's a lot to like about&nbsp;Barry Jenkins' alma mater, not the least of which is a completely waived tuition and a $10,000 stipend. In addition, students spend six weeks during their third and final year studying in London, all expenses paid. They also become full-time company members at the affiliated Asolo Repertory Theatre.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Southern Methodist University</h2><p>Gilmore Girls'&nbsp;Lauren Graham&nbsp;is a graduate of this three-year curriculum, which devotes its first year to "use of self under imaginary circumstances," its second to "immersion in classic texts" and its third to mounting full-scale productions of classics by&nbsp;Ibsen,&nbsp;Chekhov&nbsp;and&nbsp;Beckett. Tuition: $44,800 per year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>University of Missouri</h2><p>A few years ago, New York's The Acting Company — which helped launch the careers of&nbsp;Kevin Kline&nbsp;and&nbsp;Patti LuPone&nbsp;— contacted this school to propose hiring its MFA acting grads for a new production partnership. That's a testament to the quality of the talent coming out of UMKC, which works closely with Kansas City Repertory Theatre. Tuition: $25,000 per year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Depaul University</h2><p>A solid program in the country's second-largest theater hub, DePaul has introduced a course that connects students with acting jobs throughout the city. One recent grad,&nbsp;Tiffany Oglesby, has taken full advantage of local productions, appearing on Fox's&nbsp;Empire, Showtime's&nbsp;The Chi&nbsp;and NBC's&nbsp;Chicago Med. Tuition: $35,000 a year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=0.5><h2>Rutgers University</h2><p>Jeremy Davidson&nbsp;(Netflix's&nbsp;Seven Seconds) and Broadway star&nbsp;Kevin Chamberlin&nbsp;are alums of this three-and-a-half-year program, which focuses on classical training. Proximity to New York is a plus — particularly at an annual showcase presented in Manhattan for theater pros. Tuition: $29,000 per year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>CalArts</h2><p>An out-of-the-box education is what you'll get at this school 30 miles north of Hollywood and co-founded in 1961 by&nbsp;Walt Disney&nbsp;(and expanded with his&nbsp;Mary Poppins&nbsp;profits) as a center to train animators. These days, it's CalArts' acting grads who draw attention, with everyone from&nbsp;Don Cheadle&nbsp;to&nbsp;Alison Brie&nbsp;passing through its doors. Tuition: $50,000 per year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2>University of Washington</h2><p>Jane Nichols, a clowning expert, joined the faculty for a serious boost to its comedy training, and Oregon Shakespeare Festival vet&nbsp;Scott Kaiser&nbsp;has come aboard to teach "Shakespeare's Wordcraft" — a subject on which he literally wrote the book. Tuition: $28,800 per year.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.2925851703407><h2>Savannah College of Art and Design</h2><p>Backlash to the state's new abortion bill not withstanding, Georgia remains one of the busiest production hubs outside L.A., a boon for grads. SCAD has a lot going for it, like Studio A, a full production soundstage for original student content. Tuition: $38,400 a year.</p><p>Additional reporting by Alexander Modiano and Lorraine Wheat.</p><p>This story first appeared in the June 5 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
