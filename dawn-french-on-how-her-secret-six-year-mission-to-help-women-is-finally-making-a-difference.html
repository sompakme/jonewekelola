Even when she’s tackling the most serious, heart-rending issues with Comic Relief, we wait eagerly for the daft sketch or sparky punchline. However, for the past six years, Dawn has been working quietly, consistently and passionately with a charity that doesn’t have "much to be funny about", she says. "But we try to go about it in as friendly a way as we can."</p><p id=ete--pfZj5HW data-wc=63>London-based Orchid Project was founded by Julia Lalla-Maharajh in 2010 with a vision to free the world from female genital cutting (FGC), which has affected more than 200 million women and girls around the world. It works with people and grassroots organisations in those countries where the practice is prevalent, such as Kenya, Senegal and India, to try to change attitudes and practices.</p><p id=eS6wMUvXA4Ge data-wc=32>"It was an issue I knew about, felt dreadful about and was horrified by," Dawn tells HELLO!. "But as a white Western woman I felt that it wasn't my place to judge."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3d3771f44512-dawn-french-orchid-project-hibo-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eRvzNTJ52uja data-wc=16><strong>Dawn French with activist Jay K Frederick, Orchid Project founder Julia Lalla-Maharajh and author Hibo Wardere</strong></p><p id=ehxcFf7izYpy data-wc=53>Nevertheless, when she was approached by Julia six years ago and asked to help raise awareness and funds, she felt it was time for her to take action. Or, as she puts it: "From my comfortable place of safety, it was my duty to listen to people, to girls who were not safe."</p><p id=eHDB_vBizOKy data-wc=37>One of the first things Dawn learned was that the FGC isn't rooted in religious belief, as she thought, but in social norm. Parents have their daughter cut because they believe it is the right thing socially.</p><p id=e7C5l9SkP3Ch data-wc=64>"It is a very potent thing," says the actress. "If you believe your daughter will not be able to marry at all if you don't do this, as quickly as possible, and don't allow her to join her sisters who are also cut and if it’s regarded as unclean or unacceptable not to be, then you're going to hold on to that social norm."</p><p id=eNzygM9uv5f_><a class=hm-link href=#>RELATED: Dawn French reveals how 'overwhelming' city life made her retreat to Cornwall home</a></p><p id=e68YmuvbmkUy data-wc=31>Orchid works with locally trained people from the communities and villages where FGC takes place. By gaining their trust over weeks and months, the charity can slowly educate and change attitudes.</p><p id=eofrYt_ccfWf data-wc=53>"If you explain the damage that happens to people's psychology – their sexual confidence, the physiological damage, which includes urine infections, scarring, painful sex, complications in childbirth and high death rates – then people are very quick to understand," Dawn says. "But it takes a long time for people to trust each other."</p><p id=ebHXCcPN10BP data-wc=65>Dawn speaks passionately about some of the survivors who work tirelessly against FGC, including Marieme Bamba, who has had stones thrown at her while walking from village to village in Senegal to talk about cutting, Hibo Wardere, the author of the groundbreaking Cut, and Jay K Frederick, who was raised in Britain but sent to Sierra Leone when she was 15 to experience her "initiation".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a67fd7601f2a-dawn-french-orchid-project-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eOq0VcvgDv3y data-wc=27><strong>Women from communities in Senegal make an official declaration that they are ending the practice of female genital cutting after receiving help and advice from Orchid Project</strong></p><p id=eW1hkmn_zN6c data-wc=61>"It happened under the auspices of her family, who loved her but felt they had to do this in their daughter’s best interest," Dawn says. "Jay is eloquent, elegant and channelling her outrage in a very powerful way. She's also optimistic and the reason she can be is because she is part of a huge movement which is happening right now.</p><p id=eyCY2j2N5Cbv data-wc=10>"Change is going to happen," she adds. "There's no doubt."</p><p id=egD3zSwx56yT data-wc=45>The charity has already brought about some impressive results. In Senegal alone, 247 communities have declared they are abandoning FGC while 33 per cent of girls from the Masai community in south-western Kenya have gone through an alternative rite of passage ceremony and remained uncut.</p><p id=e9curoIGW4CG><a class=hm-link href=#>MORE: Dawn French opens up about the huge impact of her dad's death</a></p><p id=e0KiXZMPy8o2 data-wc=39>Since joining the cause, Dawn has hosted several fundraising events, most recently thanks to Jill Stein at the Rick Stein restaurant in south-west London, where guests included Holly Willoughby, Fearne Cotton, Emma Willis, Ruth Jones, Gok Wan and Bananarama.</p><p id=eCt6--jrQ1yA data-wc=65>Having said yes to almost every charity invitation when she first started out, Dawn realised she had to "focus on just a few things" along with her career and family. At the moment, she's busy writing her fourth novel at the Cornwall home she shares with husband Mark Bignell. "I'm locked away in my room, where I can look out to sea," she tells us.</p><p id=ep7bXqhbr4Nf data-wc=39>"I like this part of my life. I'm settled in my home, near my family, and if I have a slightly s****y day writing, it doesn't matter. This is the life I've chosen and I'm very happy with it."</p><p id=eLLnH6AbFnmi data-wc=81>As well as this, there is the third series of, the Sky drama in which she stars with Emilia Fox, to film and other "exciting projects" in the pipeline, which fans will hope include something with her comedy partner Jennifer Saunders. "It's very difficult to work with Jen because there's so much to catch up on, so much gossiping to do, so much fun to be had, that our friendship can actually get in the way of working," she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7d43816bffb8-dawn-french-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eBtX8Em1PDKj data-wc=12><strong>Dawn French is currently writing her fourth novel at home in Cornwall</strong></p><p id=ewEi51xe0eaS data-wc=28>"We spend all day having a laugh and then realise in the last half hour that we've actually got to do something and hand it to our producer."</p><p id=e4eXe2BmvDU5 data-wc=57>And now there's also speaking publicly about Orchid Project. "Thus far, I have supported Orchid quietly," she says. "But it's so important to keep the work going. This is the year of women," she adds. "Here we are – we’re mighty and we're strong. And we cannot sleep at night knowing we're not doing anything about this.</p><p id=ejv9ZYvmuON2 data-wc=21>"So from your comfortable place of safety, I urge you to please reach out and help this vital work to continue."</p><p id=ejFIxLjl2cZo data-wc=8><strong>For more information and to donate, visit</strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
