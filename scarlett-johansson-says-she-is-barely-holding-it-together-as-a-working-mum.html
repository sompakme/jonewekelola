But by her own admission, she feels like she is "barely holding it together" as a working mum. The 32-year-old star spoke candidly about her personal life as she stepped out at the amfAR Gala on Wednesday evening, her first official appearance since her split from husband <a class=hm-link href=#>Romain Dauriac</a>.

While the couple called it quits last summer, they have continued to make public appearances together, and were <a class=hm-link href=#>last seen together</a> in January at a gallery event. On Wednesday, however, Scarlett was joined on the red carpet by her mother, Melanie, and the star opened up about their close bond.
