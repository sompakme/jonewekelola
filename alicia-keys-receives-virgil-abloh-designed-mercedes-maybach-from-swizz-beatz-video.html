On the 25th of the first month of the year, the renowned vocalist celebrated with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">some sunshine in a bikini</a>, and her producer beau serenaded her, much to her pleasure. While the gift was certainly thoughtful and romantic, it has nothing on what just finally came through on Sunday (March 26).</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a video posted to her Instagram yesterday evening, the "Fallin'" hitmaker and her two sons unveiled a custom Mercedes-Maybach whip for Keys, which was designed by the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">late Virgil Abloh</a>. As her young boys remove the elegant car's dust cover, we see an utterly shocked expression on their mother's face. "Maybach Sundays 😂," the lucky recipient wrote in her caption. "I finally got to see my bday gift from the kids and my hubby 🥵🥵🥵🤯🤯🤯. RIP @virgilabloh this one is a masterpiece woooowwww🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-alicia-keys-iconic-belated-b-day-gift-from-her-husband>Alicia Keys' Iconic Belated B-Day Gift from Her Husband</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Keys' kids, Egypt, and Genesis were obviously eager to give her the long-awaited present, which she promptly sat down in. "There's no words to explain this one," the older of the children told the camera before the big reveal. "That's crazy," the R&B diva repeats while taking in the sheer beauty laying in front of her. On Swizz's IG page, he had more photos and kind words to share about his wife. "Keys open doors 🔑," his message began.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Long live @virgilabloh 🤲🏾, gifts from the kids to the Queen, always," the "Fancy" hitmaker added. Throughout his photo dump, we see Alicia Keys sitting in both the front and the back of her grandiose present. While she'll likely be spending more time in the rear, with a driver doing the heavy lifting while she relaxes, The Voice alum looks undeniably awesome riding in the driver's seat with her platinum gold heels.
