"I think that we are really blessed in the sense that we have really supportive parents and this opportunity was once in a lifetime," she told <a href=#>BollySpice</a> in March 2020.</p><p dir=ltr>Being a TV star was something that took time for Monica to adjust to. She told BollySpice about an awkward fan interaction at a mall when she caught two people looking at her. "We were playing this stare-off game just trying to recognize each other," she recalled. Monica is different from many other reality TV stars who flaunt wealth and live lavish lifestyles. "I don't have a mansion or fancy cars, I'm a regular girl who works a full-time job and strives to achieve her goals with my side hustles," she told <a href=#>Brown Girl</a>. "The dream is to work hard and take care of my family."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Despite starring on a hit Bravo show, Monica kept her job working as a software specialist. According to her <a href=#>LinkedIn page</a>, she has had multiple roles at Ultimate Software since 2015 including account manager and HR specialist. Over the years of working as a data specialist, and after a couple of seasons on "Family Karma," Monica accrued a modest net worth of around $100,000, per <a href=#>Stars Offline</a>. With Monica's work ethic, though, it's safe to say that number will continue to grow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWpkbH5ze8eormalpZi1brXSZqSoppmYrm7CwKyumqaZYrOzu8xmnZqlmaHGbrfAq6SaZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
