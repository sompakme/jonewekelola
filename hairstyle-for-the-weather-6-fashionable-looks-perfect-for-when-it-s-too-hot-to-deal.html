Well, that does not have to be your only option.</strong></p><p class=align-left>The heat <a href=#>can</a> make dressing up not as fun. With the current weather situation, the last thing anyone wants is sweaty bangs stuck to their face or long hair draped down the back of their neck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/cbc9da42a4447d53.jpg><p class=align-left>Well, it doesn't have to be so as there are many ways to keep that hair away from your face. It may be hot outside doesn't mean you can't look just as hot.</p><p class=align-left>Check out these six looks below:</p><h2>1. Be a naturalista like Bisola</h2><p class=align-left>Weaving your natural hair in protective styles can also help you brave the weather.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/01793ab6dab85b9b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Workwear fashion for women: Powede Awujo makes case for boss chic looks in 5 photos</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Here, Bisola wears her natural hair in cornrows and twists.</p><h2>2. Nancy's short hair game</h2><p class=align-left>This is the obvious answer to dealing with hot weather but not so many ladies like this option.</p><p class=align-left>However, if you're considering the big chop, try experimenting with colours and a stylish cut too.</p><h2>3. Wrap it in Bantu knots like Beverly Naya</h2><p class=align-left>This is a classic look for African beauties!</p><p class=align-left>Like Beverly, you can slay this Afrocentric style as it allows your scalp room to breathe and you don't have to deal with hair touching your face or nape</p><h2>4. Dazzle like Nengi with a braid crown</h2><p class=align-left>Whether with natural hair or extensions, braid crowns are always a win!</p><p class=align-left>While the BBNaiaj star may have used a lace frontal for this style, it is advisable to use your natural hair or add extensions so your scalp can breathe.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dbc1bad1b8c40ff8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"The transformation is magical": Woman who has been wearing only wigs for 10 years finally braids her hair</span></p></a><h2>5. Twin with BBNaija Nini with this braided bun</h2><p class=align-left>This is also another way to keep your look chic without stressing because of the weather.</p><p class=align-left>Unlike the regular bun, the <a href=#>BBNaija</a> star glammed her look with two cornrows in the front.</p><h2>6. Rock a low bun like Osas Ighodaro</h2><p class=align-left>This is the perfect look if you're going for that 'clean girl' aesthetics.</p><p class=align-left>Like Osas, you can either keep it sleek or opt for the messy bun look. While high buns are just as good, the beauty of this style comes from its simplicty.</p><h2>Edo varsity students reveal cost of their hairstyles, one lady rocks N355k human hair</h2><p class=align-left>Looking good is good business, and for some students of the <a href=#>Edo State</a> University (EDSU), no amount of money is too much or too small.</p><p class=align-left>TikTok page, @edsu_src, which is dedicated to information about the varsity, posted a video in which some students <a href=#>shared price details</a> about their hairstyles.</p><p class=align-left>The first lady was seen rocking a water curl wig with the price tag, N355k, attached to it.
