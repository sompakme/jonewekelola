However, the allegations were not made public until the 2017 #MeToo movement.&nbsp;According to <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the alleged incident occurred during a photo shoot for movie props, during which Sizemore was tasked with sitting on a couch with the young actor playing his daughter on his lap. After she told her mother what allegedly happened, Sizemore was promptly kicked off set â€” though he denied the claims.&nbsp;</p><p>An extensive review of the photos ultimately didn't show evidence of what actually transpired, with&nbsp;a&nbsp;production manager recalling, "The girl was so young it was unclear to her and [later] her parents what had actually taken place and if it was intentional or not."&nbsp;Sizemore was eventually invited back for reshoots, and her parents ultimately opted not to press charges. Still, as word of the alleged incident quickly spread, he was promptly ditched by his talent agency and management firm.</p><p>In 2020, a judge dismissed the now young woman's civil case against the actor. Sizemore stated (via&nbsp;<a href=#>USA Today</a>), "I hope this highly disturbing matter is finally over for all concerned. ... While I feel nothing but sympathy for my accuser ... I remain dismayed by her allegations." He added, "Beyond the loss of work and the pain and humiliation this has caused me and my family, the thought that an 11-year-old girl would think I violated her ... is what devastates me most."</p><p>If you or someone you know may be the victim of child abuse, please contact the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 1-800-4-A-Child (1-800-422-4453) or contact their <a href=#>live chat services</a>.</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
