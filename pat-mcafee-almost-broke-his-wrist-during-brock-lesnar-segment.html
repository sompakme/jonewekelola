McAfee truly loves pro wrestling and fans know that all too well by now. In fact, it seems McAfee almost broke his wrist during a Brock Lesnar segment.</p><p>McAfee was absent from WWE television for several months but would make his return during the Royal Rumble Premium Live Event. Michael Cole welcomed him to the commentary booth, while Corey Grave was not pleased whatsoever.</p><p>At the men’s Royal Rumble event, Brock Lesnar erupted in fury upon being ousted by Bobby Lashley, proceeding to grab the ring steps and destroy the announcer’s tables with them.</p><p>In fact, this was not the first time McAfee had a brush with The Beast Incarnate. While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>The Pat McAfee Show</a>, Pat McAfee recalled the time he almost broke his wrist during a Brock Lesnar segment, where the latter went on a rampage.</p><p>That was real close. How about when he was walking back towards us? What was that all about? I almost broke my hand the Friday before WrestleMania. Broke my wrist, almost. That was when Brock was beating the f*ck out of everybody with the chair. He was walking back, I heard the countdown in my ear, we still had another 25 seconds on live air and Brock was nowhere near stopping what he was doing. He had already hit 10 people with a chair, just killing people. He was walking back towards the commentary table. I’m like, ‘No, no no.’ We ran through the ring bell area, and a cord being pulled by a camera person, trips me through my shin. I go down, I catch myself on pavement. I get up, ‘Did I?’ [rolls his wrist]. Could you imagine actually f*cking with that guy? No way. He slammed those f*cking stairs like Bam Bam.”</p><p>As mentioned above, the original plan was for Pat McAfee to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">compete in the Men’s Royal Rumble</a>&nbsp;match.&nbsp;WWE is also <a href=#>hopeful Pat McAfee will wrestle this year</a>. We’ll have to see what’s next in store for McAfee.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
