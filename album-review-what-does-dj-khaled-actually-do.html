Not too many people could get Beyonce and Jay Z on the same track and come up with something as forgettable as <i>Shining,</i> but Khaled does. Not too many people could make Rihanna sound as tired as she does on <i>Wild Thoughts</i>, but Khaled does. Not too many people could get Chance the Rapper to sing the entire alphabet on cheese factory <i>I Love You So Much</i>, but Khaled does.</p><p>Begging for it to stop? It doesn't. Nas turned in the highlight of Khaled's last album <i>Major Key</i>; here he's teamed with Travis Scott for <i>It's Secured,</i> a tinny track six years past its use-by date. Drake's <i>To the Max</i> is clearly a cast-off by someone whose cast-offs are usually far more reliable. Even Migos sound out of sorts on <i>Major Bag Alert</i>, and that's not something they've been for at least 12 months.</p><p>Add Khaled's catch phrases - "We the best!", "And another one!", "DJ Khaled!" - into the mix and you have a bona fide mess on your hands.</p><p>Redeeming features? Sure, Future classes up almost all of the five joints he appears on, but he'd sound great doing his mumble-rap thing over a rustling chip packet. It's a shame Nicki Minaj isn't used just as much - she pulls the same trick on two. And weeks after release, <i>I'm the One</i> is still a pure pop smash that hasn't yet lost its sheen.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>But <i>Grateful's</i> high points are blunted by far too many lows and way too many woes.</p><p>There is one redeeming feature about <i>Grateful,</i> and that's the incredible cover - a photograph of Khaled's 1-year-old son, Asahd, lounging in a Jacuzzi like he was born in one. He probably was.</p><p>But when you've made an album only worth remembering for its cover art, perhaps it's time to forget about the music and stick to what you do best: Instagramming your more famous friends.</p><p><strong>DJ Khaled - Grateful</strong><br><strong>Label:</strong> Epic<br><strong>Stars:</strong> Two<br><strong>Verdict:</strong> There's nothing to be grateful for here</p><h2 class="related-articles__heading section-entertainment">Related articles</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSura7UpmSrnaaesrh51qGYrWWUpLK0ecOjZKSgkaGypXnAnKuumZyhxm6wzmh7i5CGd6OTgLeOkH6DhWyglqO3iGyBkHKNmnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
