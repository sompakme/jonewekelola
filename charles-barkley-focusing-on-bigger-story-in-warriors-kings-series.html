Green's stomp on Sacramento Kings star Domantas Sabonis will be <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the most memorable moment</a> from the 2023 Playoffs. However, the Warriors and Kings series has been more than a stomp. The Kings have jumped out to a 2-0 series lead. Something that most people weren't expecting from the young Kings team. But Barkley doesn't want the Kings performance to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">get lost in the shuffle</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When speaking on the stomp, Barkley brought up what really matters in this series. "What really bothers me about this whole thing, to be honest with you, is we're taking away from the fact that the Sacramento Kings are just kicking their ass." Barkley is not wrong in his assessment of the opening-round matchup. The Kings have handled the Warriors rather easily in the first two meetings. Which shouldn't be a surprise for a three-seed playing a six. However, when that sixth seed is the defending champion, it makes a massive difference. Check out the video of Barkley's comments below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-charles-barkley-praises-kings-recent-performance>Charles Barkley Praises Kings Recent Performance</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The series between the two has shown the world a glimpse of a new NBA star. De'Aaron Fox has been the biggest factor in the Kings 2-0 series lead. On Tuesday, the league announced Fox as the first-ever winner of the Clutch Player of the Year award. An award that Fox rightfully earned with his performance in the regular season. Now Fox is putting on a show in the playoffs, and folks like Barkley are taking notice.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">A Game 3 victory will all but seal the fate of the Golden State Warriors. The Warriors are facing their first 2-0 series deficit in the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Steph Curry</a> era. Now the team will be without Green for his actions in Game 2. It seems as if everything is lining up for the Kings to pack their brooms to Golden State. However, No one should count Curry out until he is officially gone from the playoffs. Do you agree with Charles Barkley on the performance of the Kings? Or will the Warriors be able to come from behind and shock the fan-favorite Kings? Please give us your thoughts on the series in the comment section.
