After word quickly spread of <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Zaytoven</a> <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">announcing Beast Mode 3</a> with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>, the producer took to Instagram to pump the brakes. Moreover, he revealed that someone hacked his Twitter and urged his fans to not believe anything the account is saying. While they gained hope that a trailer meant the collaborative series' next installment was coming this year, fans now have to deal with that disappointment. In his message concerning the fake news, the Atlanta beatsmith expressed confusion as to how this could've happened.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Hey, do not believe what's going on on Twitter," Zaytoven remarked in a video on his Instagram Story. "I don't know who done hacked my Twitter and what they doing, I don't know how they got what they got or why they're saying what they're saying. But do not believe my Twitter right now. I'm working to get it back. So, PSA, alright? I'm working on it." In a prior IG Story post, he wrote: "My Twitter has been hacked. Don't believe what's being posted." Still, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">this wouldn't be the first time</a> that he teased another Future collab album.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-zaytoven-got-hacked-and-beast-mode-3-with-future-is-seemingly-fake-news>Zaytoven Got Hacked, And Beast Mode 3 With Future Is Seemingly Fake News</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, looking back, this news came amid a lot of previous reports that Future is working on joint projects with other producers. One of the most notable announced team-ups is his upcoming tape with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a>, who already <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">updated fans on its status multiple time</a>s. As such, perhaps it was vain to think that we would be getting a whole lot more from the "HOLY GHOST" MC this year, but it wouldn't be out of character, either. After all, Hendrix went on very prolific runs throughout his career, as did Zaytoven with his production work.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, we should at least be expecting something from the producer soon, as he promised new music after <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">selling his catalog</a>. Whether that's with Pluto or other artists, only time will tell, but his credentials should inspire a lot of anticipation. Even though fans are hoping this is all one big PR stunt, it seems like dreams don't always come true. Apologies for the earlier false coverage. Regardless, stick around on HNHH for the latest news and updates from Zaytoven and Future.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.

Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
