NBC News correspondent Tom Winter tweeted the news late Friday, reporting that Huffman could be required to pay a $20,000 fine and spend a month in jail. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>NBC News</a> adds that prosecutors told the judge that Huffman's actions were "deliberate and manifestly criminal."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In the context of this case, neither probation nor home confinement (in a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool) would constitute meaningful punishment or deter others from committing similar crimes," the prosecutors wrote. Court papers also described the team's views that Huffman wasn't driven by "need or desperation," but rather "entitlement or at least moral cluelessness, facilitated by wealth."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The sentencing memorandum also includes more than <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>25 letters of support</a>, with selections written by her husband, fellow actor William H. Macy, and former co-star, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Eva Longoria</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Boston Globe/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Huffman's attorneys requested that the judge sentence her to a year term of probation in addition to 250 hours of community service instead of jail time. They also said that she would pay the $20,000 fine associated with her guilty plea. She'll be <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>officially sentenced</a> on September 13.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ms. Huffman is deeply remorseful for her crime. She recognizes that she deserves to be punished for what she did," her attorneys wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">John Vandemoer, Stanford University's former sailing coach, was the very <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>first individual to be sentenced</a> in the college admissions scandal. The government suggested that he be sentenced to 13 months in jail, but he only ended up spending a single day behind bars. He was found guilty of one count of racketeering conspiracy after accepting $610,000 in bribes. Though Huffman was sentenced to a month in jail, there's no way to tell exactly how long she'll spend in prison or if the judge in the case will be more lenient.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her statement, Huffman said that she was driven by the "desperation to be a good mother," adding, "all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair," she continued. "I have a deep and abiding shame over what I have done."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lori Loughlin</a>, who is also one of the 50 people involved in the FBI investigation, has pleaded not guilty and is still waiting to find out whether or not she and her husband, Mossimo Giannulli, will face jail time. Loughlin could face up to 40 years in prison on counts of conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeWmrmqr8itsGagpZuzrq3NZpqopJyatKZ5wJ2koqujnryvv4ysmpqmlJa5brzOrKqimpyaerSxza2cp5uV</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
