"She gives the best hugs and sings her tail off! See ya tonight Vegas"</p><p>The caption accompanied a video of the whole situation, in which Clarkson sings her heart out to "What's Love Got to Do With It" on the street as the performer sings and dances along but without realizing she's hearing a live perforrmance from a Grammy Award-winning artist.</p><p>The street singer then eventually realizes and starts shouting with excitement, and the two women embrace several times.</p><p>Clarkson's followers were obsessed with this sweet encounter as well.</p><p>"This is amazing…. I’d literally just pee myself," said one person.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
