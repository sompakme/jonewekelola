TV senior vp Shannon Howard, whose family has purchased a home in the area after visiting over the past 17 years. “It’s an amazing contrast to Los Angeles and a wonderful place to feel rejuvenated.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">While the area’s unpretentious ambiance persists nearly 20 years after Sideways premiered, what was a few decades earlier a sleepy clutch of ranchland towns — that also attracted the wealthy in search of space and privacy — has evolved into a celebrated wine and food mecca with a growing number of Michelin-approved restaurants, swanky shops, boutique hotels and architecturally striking wineries.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Not surprisingly, these offerings lured many Angelenos seeking to leave the city during COVID, leading to a boon for the area. “Living here feels like a permanent vacation,” says Link Entertainment talent manager Brad Stokes, who moved with his family to the area in 2021. “It’s been great for our kids, there are less distractions, and I feel more productive.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Home to the native Chumash tribe, who own and operate the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Chumash Casino Resort</a>, the Santa Ynez Valley now has its first bona fide luxury resort to boot.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Auberge Resorts Collection has just completed a renovation and expansion of the craftsman-style <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Inn at Mattei’s Tavern</a> (rooms from $950 a night), a former stagecoach stop in the town of Los Olivos that reigned as the social hub of the Santa Ynez Valley for more than a century.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/A2A75431-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Post-renovation, the inn still oozes a low-key vibe, featuring a saloon-style bar, a modernized barn for events and 67 cozy-contemporary guest rooms, including four original cottages, with four-poster beds and wood-beam ceilings. There’s also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Lavender Barn spa</a>, featuring an olive tree-dotted serenity pool and offering complimentary fitness and meditation classes along with body and facial treatments (from $180) featuring designer Jenni Kayne’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Oak Essentials skin-care line</a>. The inn’s multiple dining options are highlighted by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Tavern</a>, a restaurant where executive chef Rhoda Magbitang holds court at the open kitchen, sending out inventive yet unfussy creations such as a delightfully addictive crispy cauliflower enhanced with almond dukkah and spiced honey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/aubergeresortscollectionMAT_Accommodations_Model-Room_2022_7279.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Entertainment marketing executive John Rosenberg compares the Santa Ynez Valley — located a two-and-a-half-hour drive northwest from L.A. — to another beloved wine growing destination with undulating hillsides across the Atlantic. “The topography is similar to Tuscany, and you have an incredible lifestyle with outstanding food and wine,” says Rosenberg, whose family (including his father Lee, a founder of Triad Talent Agency) has lived in Los Olivos for more than 20 years. “Between horseback riding, golf, and the arts, there’s also a bit of culture for all ages while maintaining that small town feel. Being flashy or ostentatious is rejected here.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">THR looks at more beguiling spots to visit in the valley, which encompasses six hamlets, each emanating their own distinctive flair: the Danish-inspired village of Solvang; the historic town of Santa Ynez; the tony Los Olivos (brimming with tasting rooms), the burgeoning towns of Ballard and Buellton, and Los Alamos, steeped in authentic Western heritage.</p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-l">Solvang</h2><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Teeming with Scandinavian architecture and mom-and-pop shops crammed with colorful tchotchkes, Solvang (meaning “sunny fields”) is a windmill-speckled village founded in 1911 by Danish immigrants searching for a plentiful region to uphold Denmark’s traditions in America. It’s situated on land bordering the Old Mission Santa Inés.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">European-style bakeries offering pastries and butter-drenched cookies still pervade the quaint, pedestrian-friendly epicenter bordered by Copenhagen, Atterdag, Alisal and Mission Streets, but so do newer, award-winning cafes, quaint museums showcasing art and the heritage of Denmark, wine tasting rooms helmed by imaginative vintners, and newly refined inns.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Situated in the center of the village is <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Landsby</a> (from $299 a night), a full-service, 51-room hotel decked out in Scandinavian charm. It’s home to a bustling bar scene and one of the area’s culinary delights, Mad & Vin restaurant. With its courtyard gardens (one of them overlooks <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jule Hus</a>, the town’s jubilant Christmas shop) —&nbsp;peppered with outdoor seating nooks, fire pits and twinkling light —&nbsp; you’ll be inclined to linger in this inviting setting for hours.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Other stays include <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Winston</a> (from $305) built inside the historic Old Mill Clock Tower, where “touchless” service means guests check in solely with an access code and nary a front desk staffer in sight. Each of the 14 individually designed guest rooms, some of the more spacious in town, incorporate splashes of jewel tones and oversized headboards.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">And industry-frequented <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alisal Ranch</a> (from $595, inclusive of breakfast and dinner), is where Kevin Costner has vacationed. Swathing guests in a down-home rustic luxe aesthetic, the resort — located just a couple of miles from the center of town —&nbsp;offers horseback riding, archery, golf, family game nights, locally sourced ranch cuisine, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellowstone vibes galore</a>. From March 19-23, Alisal is offering its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WildWonder retreat</a> designed to spark curiosity in inspiring new experiences such as a coffee workshop, cooking demos, intention setting, and line dancing lessons, all lead by celebrated artisans.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Alisal-Ranch-Solvang-CA.png><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Where there’s exceptional wine, there’s obsession-worthy food, and Solvang delivers in droves. Chef Michael Cherney and his wife Sarah opened <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Peasants Feast</a> in 2020 two weeks after COVID hit. Their mac & cheese, buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, carnitas tacos, and numerous other comforting delicacies sustained the community and weekenders during challenging times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/lenabrittphotography.com-156-EMBED-2023.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Now, nearly three years later, the restaurant has been touted with a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Michelin Bib Gourmand distinction</a> and they’ve expanded. Just across the street is their second establishment, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Peasants Deli & Market</a>, where visitors line up for freshly sliced Iberico ham, flawlessly roasted pastrami sandwiches, Instagram-famous caviar cones, Kobe beef carpaccio, and other gastronomical pleasures, adjoined by their newly opened 90’s inspired arcade complete with pinball machines and Pac-Man.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/peasantscones_140339.png><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Juicy tomahawk steaks and truffled orzo risotto are just some of the top menu items at <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Sear Steakhouse</a>, now under the command of owner and executive chef Nathan Peitso, whose family is behind Kenter Canyon Farms and Roan Mills. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Leonardo’s</a> is the go-to for elegant Italian dishes including short rib ravioli and chicken marsala. The lively <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Fitzpatrick’s Tavern</a>, located right below The Winston Hotel, whips up a solid corned beef and cabbage, Cobb salad with house made dressing, and other pub fare. If you’re with the little ones, the burgers, salads and fries at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Chomp</a> always deliver (and there are one-of-a-kind finds next door at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vanderlei Vintage</a>).</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Satisfy your sweet tooth directly across the street at <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Swedish Candy Factory</a>, home to Stafford’s Chocolates, where Polkagris, the Swedish candy stick invented in 1859, is handmade on site. A traditional Solvang breakfast is necessary and that’s what you’ll find at <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Belgian Café</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paula’s Pancake House</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Solvang Restaurant</a> where visitors line up for Aebleskivers (the famed tennis ball-shaped pancakes) doused with powdered sugar and raspberry glaze. And some of the town’s tastiest cookies and pastries are at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Danish Mill Bakery</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Then there’s the vino. But first, a brief lay of the land. The Santa Ynez Valley is made up of a number of distinct AVA’s (American Viticultural Areas). There’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Happy Canyon</a>, the warmest micro-climate and prized for Cabernet Sauvignon, among other classic Bordeaux varietals including Merlot, Malbec, Sauvignon Blanc. Then there’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Los Olivos</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Ballard Canyon</a>, where Rhône (Syrah, Grenache, Viognier) and Bordeaux varietals also flourish, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Santa Rita Hills</a>, regarded for top-drawer Chardonnay and Pinot Noir (the favorite of Miles, Paul Giamatti’s character in Sideways) thanks to the marine layer and Pacific Ocean breezes that create an ideal microclimate for the grapes. Pro tip: most winery/vineyard visits require reservations, and tastings generally last 60 to 90 minutes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Solvang is home to more than 15 tasting rooms, including vintner Dana Volk’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dana V. Wines</a>. She specializes in handcrafted Pinot Noir, Syrah, Grenache Rosé, and Chardonnay, and has an expansive outdoor patio. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Feliz Noche Cellars</a> is where vineyard manager/winemaker Felipe Hernandez creates Mi Pasión (a knockout red blend), Tempranillo and Cabernet Sauvignon.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Crawford Family Wines</a> is also worth a visit for a taste of their Pinots as is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lost Chord Guitars</a>, a music venue-meets-art gallery and guitar shop owned by guitarist and songwriter Chris Peloni and his wife Kim. Wine and beer are served and if you’re lucky you might catch Jeff Bridges performing with his band The Abiders; Peloni is their music director.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Gretchen-Carbonic-Vineyard.jpeg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For a deeper dive into the winemaking process and some of the most astounding views of the surrounding hills, a tasting with <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Gretchen Voelcker</a> of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Piazza Family Wines</a> and her own label, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Luna Hart Wines</a>, is enlightening. Voelcker emphasizes organic fruits and unfiltered wines with minimal human interference to “enhance the aromatics,” she says, and relishes melding science and creativity with a dash of “woo-woo” in her poetic winemaking: “I rack in conjunction with the moon.” After tasting her Sauvignon Blanc and Graciano, you’ll toast to her celestial approach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Rusack-Canyon-Terrace-1.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Afternoons here are made for sipping fine wines and nibbling on charcuterie amid oak-tree-sprinkled vineyards. <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Buttonwood Farm Winery and Vineyard,</a> part of the Gleason Family’s portfolio, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rusack Vineyards</a> are two of the most tranquil spots to indulge in these pleasures. Further enticements at Buttonwood include a bites menu, available Friday to Sunday, along with a curated marketplace of sundries and freshly picked produce from the estate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/R5__8017-EMBED-2023.jpg><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-l">Santa Ynez</h2><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Once quiet and unassuming, the Western-style town of Santa Ynez is abuzz and where you’ll now find some of the valley’s best dining options and appealing boutiques, along with tasting rooms like <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Cross Hatch</a>, slowly starting to pop up. It’s also the location of the 14,000-square-foot <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Santa Ynez Chumash Museum and Cultural Center</a>, slated to open this year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Discerning shoppers will be right at home at <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Santa Ynez General</a> and vintage fashion shop <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Brass Tack</a>. One can even have a bespoke hat designed at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">KJ Murphy’s</a> by the chapeau master himself, Kevin Murphy.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">For salads, sandwiches and baked goodies, go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Lucky Hen Larder</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>The Baker’s Table</a> or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pony Espresso</a>. With its clapboard interiors and vast outdoor deck, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Victor</a>, with dishes like mesquite-grilled Santa Maria tri-tip frites, is the newest entry to the town’s restaurant scene. It’s adjacent to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santa Ynez Inn</a> (from $399), which is undergoing a refresh and will reemerge as The Genevieve around March 15.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">One of the most blissful retreats is the 22-room <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hotel Ynez</a> (from $167). Tucked away on a hilltop, this 22-room sanctuary offers an oak-tree-shrouded central courtyard with bocce ball court, cozy firepits and loungers (even more lovely in the evening with the twinkling lanterns), along with a parasol-surrounded swimming pool and guest rooms featuring designer bedding, patterned textiles, and outdoor hammocks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/hotelynezpropertywithtrees.png><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Feast on traditional American cuisine such as prime rib, perfectly chilled hearts-of-romaine salad with roasted garlic dressing and baked horseradish-dill crusted salmon at the consistently enjoyable <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Brothers Restaurant at Red Barn</a>.

Nestled in the far eastern foothills of Santa Ynez, Happy Canyon sees summer temperatures that often exceed 100 degrees. There, visitors can find several vanguard producers of estate-grown, full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon and other Bordeaux varietals. Roger Bower, owner of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Crown Point Vineyards</a>, looked to Napa when it was time to appoint a winemaker, tapping Simon Faury (who hails from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>globally revered Harlan Estate</a>).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/crownpointvineyard.png><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">There’s also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Happy Canyon Vineyard</a>, home to the Santa Ynez Valley Polo Classic, where executive winemaker and president Sean D.
