The troubled and highly-controversial Florida rapper has brought a lot of issues into his life through various methods. In fact, not too long along ago, fans were taken aback by his response to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">being compared to</a> <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Diddy</a> because of his new haircut. "B**** you got me f***ed up. No Diddy. Take that Take it. I’ll smack me a elderly b****, I even might k*ll me a kid but I aint r*ping. I mean kill him as a baby, but I ain’t raping. I ain’t doing that." But Kodak Black continues to show tremendous personal growth and his new look is proof of that.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">About a week ago, he shared how happy he has been as of late after <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">cutting back severely on his Percocet intake</a>. "I remember a point in my life when I was chewing a lot of Percs. Bro, I'm proud of myself. I've never been this happy in my life, bro. I don't know where this came from,&nbsp;what the f**k going on... My dosage so low that I can't believe it myself. Man, I'm telling y'all, bro." With all of this hard work, Kodak is seeing the results tenfold and so are fans, especially the ladies.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-kodak-black-is-the-new-sex-symbol>Kodak Black Is The New Sex Symbol?</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">According to The Shade Room, they tracked down tons of women's stunning reactions to the new Kodak. Some were even calling him "fine" on Twitter after seeing a video of him at a recent Phoenix Suns game. However, others were not willing to push that agenda yet, but they are very proud of the rapper for making these changes. "Fine is a stretch, but he looks BETTER and healthy. Love that for him," one person said underneath the IG post above.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What are your thoughts on Kodak Black and his new look?
