The news comes after the supporting cast was expected to renegotiate their contracts for season seven and after Harmon and Alexander renegotiated their deals together last season.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The cop drama ranks as one of basic cable’s top five series every year in total viewers. It was last summer’s top show on basic cable in the metric. Jan Nash, who took over as <span data-scayt_word=showrunner data-scaytid=1>showrunner</span> after creator Janet <span data-scayt_word="Tamaro's" data-scaytid=2>Tamaro’s</span> departure, will return for its final season.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The decision to end Rizzoli & Isles comes as TNT is plotting a new and edgier direction with series including Animal Kingdom, Good Behavior and the newly ordered Tales From the Crypt horror block. Reilly told reporters that he expects the network’s turnaround to take at least three years.&nbsp;</p><br>Rizzoli & Isles becomes the latest TNT series to come to an end under Reilly, who also <a href=# id=auto-tag_canceled data-tag=canceled>canceled</a> Public Morals, Agent X and Legends recently. The executive told reporters Thursday that some of those decisions were based on ratings as well as the fact that the series didn’t fit in with his overall vision for the network. He singled out Major Crimes, which returns for an abbreviated 13-episode fifth season in the summer, as a show that doesn’t quite fit with the network that continues to stick around based on its ratings performance.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOq6Czsp%2Bhtm610qWcrGWVo7Fuv8SaqqimXaiyt7HNZm9uamhug3A%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
