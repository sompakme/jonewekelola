This altercation, which ended with twenty-one year old, Ethan Walker being murdered, led to Tay-K being placed on house arrest. At 10:59, March 26th ,2017 Tay-K &nbsp;posted this tweet, after which he proceeded to cut off his ankle monitor.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This all culminated in him releasing “The Race” on Youtube, but was later arrested in New Jersey on Friday, June 30th, 2017, on the very same day. Following his most recent arrest, he had been identified as a suspect in a number of crimes, one of which occurred after his self-liberation from house arrest. These crimes were a robbery of a sixty-five year old man in Arlington Craven Park, which occurred on May 25th, 2017, and his involvement in another murder in San Antonio, TX following a performance with the Daytona Boyz, at a New Year’s Bash, on December 31st, 2015.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Why did he go viral?</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>His notorious track “The Race,” which was released on the day of his arrest, has since become a viral hit. Within the song, he stated that if he killed someone and he got caught, he would run.
