In the brand's shared photo, Styles poses cheekily with a bottle of Villa Manodori's best held close to his face. He wears a green-and-white-striped T-shirt tucked into a pair of blue jeans and white sneakers with pink and white laces. Of the utmost concern, however, is the furry creature relaxing lackadaisically in the spot above his upper lip and below his '70s-dad-styled tinted sunglasses.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Many thanks for your visit <a href=# tabindex=0 data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/harrystyles/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@harrystyles class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">@harrystyles</a>," the olive oil company captioned the photo, which was taken at Casa Maria Luigia.
