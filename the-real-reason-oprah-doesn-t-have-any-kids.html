As a result, Oprah lived with her grandma Hattie Mae Lee. When her grandma's life was coming to a close, Oprah was sent to live with her mom. She shared, "So at six, I am introduced to this woman who I'm told is my mother." They had a very unconventional relationship, with Oprah admitting, "for years, I was asking the question ... what is a mother? What are you supposed to feel about your mother?"&nbsp;</p><p>Growing up, she thought to herself, "I am alone. I must take care of myself." Then, things got even more complicated once Oprah became a household name. She explained, "When I became wealthy, everyone's like, 'You've got to take care of your mother!' My own mother is like, 'You've got to take care of me!' And I'm like, 'But what are you supposed to feel for your mother?' I still didn't know." Ultimately, she concluded, &nbsp;"Even though there are times when I think [she] could have done better, I know [she] did the best [she] knew how to do."</p><p>While there's absolutely nothing wrong with Oprah not having children, it's understandable why some people might be curious about why she's made that decision. That being said, she has channeled everything she's been through into giving back to many people, including children, many of whom she considers to be her own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2hlZ4Nye9OhnGaqlZa5br7Emqqopl2kvbOtx2abqJ2jo8FutMCvnGaZnq56rLXDrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
