In February, he released his breakthrough film, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. Five months later in July, Carrey’s The Mask made over $350 million worldwide. In December, Carrey ended his massive year with Dumb and Dumber, the Farrelly brother comedy that made over $247 million. Over the years, the Dumb and Dumber franchise has had various sequels and prequels, but if a new rumor is to be believed, Carrey might be looking to make yet another Dumb and Dumber film.</p><p>The rumor comes from <a href=#>We Got This Covered</a>, who is reporting that gossip writer Daniel Richtman has said that both Jim Carrey and the studio are interested in returning to the Dumb and Dumber world. It is not clear where Richtman has heard this news from, but it seems to be the latest of many recent 90s <a href=#>reboots</a> he has speculated about lately.&nbsp;</p><p>Dumb and Dumber does keep coming back every decade or so, becoming an extremely odd franchise. After Dumb and Dumber was released in 1994, New Line Cinema decided to show audiences the first time these two idiots met with 2003’s Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd. With the Farrelly Brothers, Jim Carrey, and Jeff Daniels all absent from this film, it failed at the box office, making only $39 million worldwide. However, in 2014 the whole team reunited for Dumb and Dumber To, which ended up making $169 million globally, a respectable amount for a sequel 20 years after the original.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2016172-edited.jpg><p>Even though it was unclear for quite some time whether or not Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels would return for Dumb and Dumber To, the film eventually came together, even though it wasn’t quite as beloved by fans as the original. While the sequel took a while to get going, it seems that now the seal has been torn, maybe Carrey and Daniels would be open for more? In a 2018 reunion on Conan, the two waxed <a href=#>nostalgic</a> about the first film and even defended Dumb and Dumber To. Yet maybe Carrey and Daniels would like to reunite once again to make a more beloved follow-up.</p><p>But even if Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are onboard, the career trajectory for co-director Peter Farrelly has taken a strange turn, which could leave the series without its usual writer and director. In 2019, Peter Farrelly became a two-time Oscar winner, having co-written and directed the Best Picture winner, Green Book. While Peter Farrelly directed Green Book on his own, his next film looks like it will be made with his brother Bobby Farrelly.&nbsp;</p><p>The Farrelly brother’s next film is based on the book The Greatest Beer Run Ever, written by John “Chick” Donohue and J.T. Molloy. The book revolves around the two authors who decided to deliver beer to their friends in Vietnam during the 1960s. While it’s unclear whether or not this will be more serious than the Farrelly Brothers’ usual films, it does seem like a rather comedic story, punctuated with some dramatic moments. Maybe adapt the story to put Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels as the two friends and make this the third Dumb and Dumber instead.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/maxresdefault-1-edited.jpg><p>Yet despite Jim Carrey once being one of the world’s most famous comedic actors, he hasn’t made too many sequels. Carrey did make Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls only a year after Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, but after that, Carrey wasn’t involved in a sequel to one of his films until Dumb and Dumber To. While there rumors that How the Grinch Stole Christmas or A Series of Unfortunate Events would kickstart new franchises, nothing became of those sequels. Carrey, however, is signed on to reprise his role as Dr. Robotnik in the Sonic the Hedgehog sequel, and he is credited as appearing as his The Mask character <a href=#>Stanley Ipkiss</a> in the upcoming Space Jam: A New Legacy.</p><p>Even if there is an audience for a third Dumb and Dumber film, it seems like wishful thinking at this point that it’s anywhere close to happening. The lead up to Dumb and Dumber To was an arduous journey, where both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels questioned whether they wanted to be involved, and with Peter Farrelly a new Oscar winner, it’s unclear what kind of projects he wants to work on now. A third Dumb and Dumber (Dumb and Dumber Tree?) could come eventually, but considering Carrey, Daniels, or the Farrelly’s have said nothing about a potential project, it would probably be a dumb idea to hold your breath just yet.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2iimaJ6pK3Rq5yyZaOavraxy2aaqKWVmcZvtNOmow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
