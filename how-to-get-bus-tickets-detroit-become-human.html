in Detroit: Become Human</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:24><span>So you've just booked it out of dodge (or should we say,</span><span> CyberLife headquarters?</span><span>),</span><span> and freedom's sweet siren song is beckoning from a northbound bus.</span><span> But hold on there,</span><span> Sparky!</span><span> Those shiny chrome legs won't get you very far without a little green (or,</span><span> you know,</span><span> paper).</span><span> This guide will be your roadmap to navigating the treacherous terrain of Detroit's bus network,</span><span> all without getting flagged by those pesky android detectors.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:69>The Ticket Thicket: Where to Find Those Precious Pieces of Paper</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:67><strong>Option 1: The Classic Case of "Finders Keepers, Losers Weepers"</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:323><span>Let's be honest,</span><span> in this messed-up world,</span><span> sometimes good things come to those who,</span><span> well,</span><span> take them.</span><span> Keep your optics peeled for any flustered humans who might have misplaced their precious tickets.</span><span> Maybe a stressed-out businessman fumbling in his briefcase,</span><span> or a frantic mother juggling a screaming toddler and a purse that looks like it's about to explode.</span><span> </span><strong>Just a word of caution:</strong><span> becoming a full-fledged pickpocket might not be the best look for your burgeoning sentience.</span><span> Play it cool,</span><span> act natural,</span><span> and that golden ticket could be yours (with a healthy dose of moral ambiguity,</span><span> of course).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=11:1-11:35><strong>Option 2: The Art of the Barter</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=13:1-13:388><span>Think MacGyver,</span><span> but with better fashion sense.</span><span> Do you have any spare android components lying around?</span><span> Maybe a malfunctioning LED or a slightly singed motherboard?</span><span> Those could be your bargaining chips in the black market (assuming you can find one that doesn't reek of expired oil and despair).</span><span> Just remember,</span><span> negotiation is key.</span><span> Don't get ripped off by some shady chrome-plated hustler!</span></p><p data-sourcepos=15:1-15:29><strong>Option 3: The "Hail Mary"</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=17:1-17:240><span>This one's a gamble,</span><span> folks.</span><span> You could always try sweet-talking your way past the bus driver with your most endearing puppy-dog eyes (or,</span><span> uh,</span><span> the closest thing an android has).</span><span> Maybe a heartfelt plea about escaping robot-slavery will tug at their heartstrings.</span><span> </span><strong>WARNING:</strong><span> This tactic has a very low success rate,</span><span> and might land you facing a very confused (and possibly trigger-happy) human with a taser.</span><span> Proceed with extreme caution.</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=19:1-19:39><strong>Bonus Tip: The Sneaky Stowaway</strong></h3><p data-sourcepos=21:1-21:381><span>Feeling adventurous?</span><span> Why not try sneaking onto the bus?</span><span> Just make sure you can contort your body into some impressive origami shapes to avoid detection.</span><span> Remember,</span><span> Detroit's winters are brutal,</span><span> so clinging to the undercarriage isn't exactly a luxury cruise.</span><span> This option is best left as a last resort,</span><span> unless you fancy a close encounter with some very cold,</span><span> very unforgiving road.</span></p><h2 data-sourcepos=23:1-23:28><strong>FAQ: Bus Ticket Blues</strong></h2><p data-sourcepos=25:1-25:32><strong>How to find the bus

data-sourcepos=29:1-29:53><strong>How to avoid getting caught by android detectors?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=31:1-31:108><span>Invest in a good ol' fashioned hat and scarf.</span><span> Maybe

off.</span></p><p data-sourcepos=37:1-37:31><strong>How to survive the journey?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=39:1-39:162><span>Pack light (those extra processing cores can weigh you

Canada?</strong></p><p data-sourcepos=43:1-43:157><span>That,</span><span> my friend,</span><span> is a whole other adventure!</span><span> But hey,</span><span> at least you've got the first step
