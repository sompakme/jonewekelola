This strategic expansion allows Browne to maintain his unique design voice while reaching a broader audience. His shows are highly anticipated events within the fashion calendar, celebrated for their theatricality and the intricate storytelling that complements each collection.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Browne's success is not solely due to his creative talents but also his savvy understanding of the fashion business. In 2018, the brand took a significant step forward when Ermenegildo Zegna acquired a majority stake, providing the resources and infrastructure for global expansion while allowing Browne to continue as the chief creative officer. This partnership illustrates Browne's strategic approach to growing his brand. He ensured it remained at the forefront of luxury fashion while preserving its creative integrity.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-cultural-impact-amp-personal-brand>Cultural Impact & Personal Brand</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - JULY 19: Designer Thom Browne poses during Surface Magazine Presents.
