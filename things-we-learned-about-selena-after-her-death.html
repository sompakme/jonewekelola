Carlos Valdez, the district attorney of Nueces County in 1995 who persecuted Saldívar for Quintanilla's murder, told <a href=#>Texas Monthly</a>&nbsp;that Quintanilla said, "Lock the door! She will shoot me again!" before passing out. An employee was able to wake her up and ask her who shot her. The final words she'd ever speak were, "Yolanda Saldívar in room 158."</p><p dir=ltr>Per AP News,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Corpus Christi paramedic testified in court&nbsp;that when he was trying to save her, she had something clenched in her fist."When I opened it, a ring fell out," Richard Fredrickson said. "It was covered with blood." Phillip Randolph was the owner of Phillip Randolph Jewelry, where Saldívar bought the ring. "It was a fourteen-karat gold ring topped with a white-gold egg, encrusted with 52 diamonds. The letter S was incorporated into the band design three times on each side," he told Texas Monthly.</p><p>"This was a friendship ring that Selena had been wearing, and Selena took it off during their argument. I think that's what set Yolanda off," Valdez told Texas Monthly. "[Saldívar] knew that once Selena walked out of that room her world was over. She would either go back to being a nobody, or she would go to prison for embezzlement." Quintanilla had no pulse when she arrived at the hospital and was pronounced dead at 1:05 p.m. on March 31, 1995.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma3FoZ4Nze9OhoKefo2LEpnnLnpirppWZeqKuzq6rZquVobKvrYyana2domK1pr6MnZyarJhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
