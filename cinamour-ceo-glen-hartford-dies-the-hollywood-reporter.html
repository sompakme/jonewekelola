He was 45.</p><p>Hartford’s death comes less than two weeks after the company completed its most successful effort at the Cannes Film Festival, said Cord Douglas, who has served as Cinamour’s distribution president since its founding in June 2000.</p><p>“The company is growing,” Douglas said. “It’s a shock. It was the best Cannes we’ve ever had. Ten or 11 days later he’s dead.”</p><p>A film that Hartford conceived 10 years ago, the boxing-themed “From Mexico With Love,” will be Cinamour’s first self-produced theatrical release when it receives a platform bow in August.</p><p>Cinamour represents more than 100 film and TV titles. It’s behind such TV series as “Haunted Hotels,” “Saving the Endangered Species” and a follow-up to “America’s Toughest Bounty Hunters” and recent films like “Finding Bliss,” starring Leelee Sobieski and Jamie Kennedy; “Silent Venom,” starring Luke Perry and Tom Berenger, which will air on Sci Fi; and “Christmas Clause,” starring Lea Thompson, to air on ABC Family and Ion.</p><p>Cinamour also is a majority shareholder in GM Studios, an audio and video postproduction facility.</p><p>Hartford began his entertainment career as a actor with roles in “The Spectre of Edgar Allan Poe” (1971), “Monster” (1980) with John Carradine and “Hell Squad” (1986). All were written and/or directed by his father, Kenneth Hartford.</p><p>Among Hartford’s survivors are his wife Cheryl and two children — daughter Emelia, 15, and son Ryan, 11.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmnKGelrqwwdFmmp6nXZy5prqMoZirrJakv6V5w6KcrGVoaYV0hY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
