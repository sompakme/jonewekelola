He is certainly one of the best pro wrestlers to have ever graced the squared circle.&nbsp;</p><p>He has competed against the best of the best that the professional wrestling world has to offer. This is especially true during his time on Smackdown in the early 2000s as well.</p><p>While speaking on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Kurt Angle Show</a>&nbsp;podcast, Kurt Angle talked about his match against Triple H at Unforgiven 2000. It was revealed on the show that women in the stands were showing their breasts during episodes of RAW and Smackdown.</p><p>Angle duked it out with Eddie Guerrero in a match on SmackDown a few weeks before his match at Unforgiven. Lawler told fans during a commercial break that they had two minutes during the break to show off their puppies, something that Angle didn’t appreciate.</p><p>“It was the worst idea in the world for Jerry Lawler to have fans show their puppies. Whether it’s during the show or during commercial break, that’s when the fans don’t get involved the match anymore. They’re more interested in seeing naked women in the crowd – and I don’t blame them for that [laughs]. The thing is, it’s something that we tried, it was the wrong thing and we didn’t do it anymore after that.’</p><p>Kurt Angle proved that he still has pro wrestling in his veins no matter what after returning to RAW earlier this month. We will have to wait and see whether the WWE Hall of Famer will make his return to WWE television somewhere down the line or not.</p><p><strong>What do you think of what Kurt Angle said?
