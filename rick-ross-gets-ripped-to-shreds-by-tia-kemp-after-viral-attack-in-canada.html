Reportedly, he instructed his DJ to play <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>'s hit track "Not Like Us," prompting some tension among attendees. In various clips making their rounds online, he's seen getting <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">punched in the face</a>, prompting his crew to jump in. The men who went after Ross are rumored to be <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> fans, though this is still unconfirmed at the time of writing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As countless social media users and peers share their <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">reactions</a> to the unexpected debacle, Ross' ex-wife Tia Kemp also decided to jump in, roasting the father of her child on Instagram Live. "They f*ckin' his fat a** up," she says in a clip from the stream. "I'm glad they smacked the sh*t out yo big a**."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-tia-kemp-reacts-to-rick-ross-vancouver-altercation>Tia Kemp Reacts To Rick Ross' Vancouver Altercation</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Kemp continued, also mocking Ross relentlessly for what she saw as his failed attempt to fight back. This doesn't necessarily come as a surprise, considering <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the nature of their relationship</a> these days. Nonetheless, some viewers think she should have at least an inkling of sympathy for her former partner. Fortunately, he doesn't appear to be too fazed by the shocking incident, based on some of his latest social media posts.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As footage of the fight circulated earlier today, he took to his Instagram Story to send a brief message to his followers. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Vancouver was fun, til next time,"</a> he wrote. He also took to the comments section of The Shade Room to joke that he thought his attackers were simply "bottle service boys," making light of the bizarre incident.
