During the <a href=#>season six premiere</a>, she admitted to sleeping with Jax Taylor, who was dating his now-wife Brittany Cartwright, and she claimed her period was late.&nbsp;</p><p>Adding to the controversy was the fact that Faith was accused of sleeping with Jax&nbsp;"in front of a 95-year-old woman that Stowers was taking care of," which is something she denied, per <a href=#>People</a>. Additionally, Faith recorded the encounter, which allegedly included remarks that Jax made about being not being attracted to Brittany and having zero desire to marry her, per <a href=#>E! News</a>.</p><p>Even though Faith only appeared in one other episode, she was&nbsp;the&nbsp;talk of the entire season in addition to being referenced in the show's next two seasons. For context, season 6 started in December 2017 and the show typically films each season the summer before the episodes air.&nbsp;</p><p>Before all that, Faith <a href=#>worked at Lisa Vanderpump's restaurant SUR</a> and filmed with Lala Kent and James Kennedy. She and Lala caught some heat <a href=#>for taking their tops off</a> during the cast vacation in Hawaii and in <a href=#>LVP's pool</a>. During that season, Faith was <a href=#>hooking up with Lisa's son, Max Todd</a>, who was never a cast member, but he did go on that Hawaii trip.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2lpZX16e9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5xZqgraBdqMGww8Srqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
