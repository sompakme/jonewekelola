Chris Brown</h2><p class=align-left>The US music star has remained accessible to the afrobeats cause from inception and it comes as no surprise that he has tracks with frontrunners of the genre.</p><p class=align-left>Davido and Brown have worked on a couple of successful music collaborations together, with their relationship moving from professional to 'brotherly'.</p><p class=align-left>Blow My Mind, Shopping Spree and Lower Body are some of their tracks together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/199e19175f0389ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The tragedy and incredible life of Daniel Johnston</span></p></a><h2>3.

Meek Mill</h2><p class=align-left>This was yet another music collaboration between the 30BG musician and international rap star, Meeks Mills.</p><p class=align-left>The track titled, Fans Mi, became an instant hit with many praising the seamless blend of sounds between the two.</p><p class=align-left>Davido also made sure to release an official music video to the delight of fans.</p><p></p><h2>5. Summer Walker</h2><p class=align-left>In the same album that had a collaboration with Chris Brown, Davido pulled another surprise with a track featuring Summer Walker.</p><p class=align-left>Fans had been left with speculations about what to expect after the tracklist for A Good Time was released, but were they pleasantly surprised?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/7c1933b241bea71d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mr Eazi - Let Me Live My Life was a show stopper at Coachella</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The track became an instant favourite for many and the synergy between Davido and Walker in the official video increased streaming numbers.</p><p></p><h2>6.

Tinashe</h2><p class=align-left>For his least favourite project, Son of Mercy, Davido worked with international songstress Tinashe on a track titled How Long.</p><p class=align-left>To this day, the 30BG musician doesn't have a lot of positive words for the entire project as it wasn't exactly his best.</p><p class=align-left>However, the track with Tinashe was an indication of his potential to blend perfectly with the western sound.</p><p></p><h2>8. Wale</h2><p class=align-left>Just like Chris Brown, Nigerian-American rapper, Wale, was among the first crop of international stars who opened their arms to the afrobeats star.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d90a0f399e9dbd16.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Daddy Yankee net worth and amazing career</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2017, Wale collaborated with Davido and indigenous rap musician, Olamide, on a track titled Fine Girl.</p><p class=align-left>An official video featuring all three music stars was also released.</p><p></p><h2>9.
