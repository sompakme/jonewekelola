Confession: The undies were so comfortable and flattering, they never made it to the festivities. The pair intended for the bride is currently on my person. As for the others: three are strewn in my hamper, while one pair is currently squirreled away in my underwear drawer, ready for me to wear tomorrow. (To quell my greed-fueled guilt, I supplanted the thongs <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">with these now on-sale rings</a> — which were a hit.)&nbsp;</p><p>I’d paid full-price for the aforementioned five-pack, shelling out over $100 for the brand’s lacey, low-rise thongs. Pricey? Perhaps. But, as Hanky Panky fans can attest, they’re unequivocally flattering, comfortable, and of unmatched quality. That’s why I’m stocking up while Hanky Panky’s low-rise thongs are over 50 percent off in an array of vibrant hues —&nbsp;and you should, too.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>$54 (Originally $120); <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">nordstrom.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p>I should’ve known my love for Hanky Panky underwear would supersede any benevolent intentions I’d had for the bachelorette party. The thongs, which come in low-rise and the brand’s <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">best-selling original-rise cut</a> (also on sale) are designed to flatter and enhance virtually all body types. My nondescript derriere appears perkier when I slip them on, and my friends, who span an array of shapes and sizes, report similar experiences with Hanky Panky thongs. Another fan of the brand: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Jennifer Aniston</a>, who famously revealed her obsession in a 2020 Q&A with Sandra Bullock <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>for Interview magazine</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $32 (Originally $72); <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">nordstrom.com</a></p><p>The secret is the brand’s V-front and -back waistband — its signature design feature — which slopes and falls in just the right places. Equal parts flattering and functional, the band holds the thong snugly against the skin, making them impervious to slipping or bunching. And though they are secure, these thongs are anything but tight; the waistband is crafted from stretchy, lay-flat lace that resists digging into the sides of the skin. Moreover, the bunch-proof band makes for traceless wear under any garment (read: no VPL).&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The band is made from a nylon and spandex blend, which defies the scratchy feel lace-trimmed underwear can often impart. As for the rest of the thong, the body is 100 percent nylon, and the interior lining is made from high-quality, breathable cotton. The overall fabric composition makes these thongs comfortable and durable. In fact, the five-pack I snagged last summer is holding up pristinely. The colors and fabric look as vibrant and new as the day I, er, decided to nab them from the bachelorette gift bags.&nbsp;</p><p>Frankly — and, again, selfishly — I’m reluctant to even spread news of this stellar sale for fear of spurring a sold-out status before I can snag ‘em for myself. But, if you’re considering shopping the Hanky Panky thong sale, I’d advise doing so this very instant. I’m not alone in my fervor for these thongs, so act quickly if you want a pack for yourself before they’re gone; when fan-favorites are over 50 percent off, it’s only a matter of time before they’re sold out — especially with Valentine’s Day right around the corner.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qlpLFdpa6vt9hmq6Gnnpx6s7HVopywZaOWuaZ5lmlwbG5obg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
