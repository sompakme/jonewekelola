Vanderpump Rules star <a href=#><strong>James Kennedy</strong></a> showed the world his new girlfriend <strong>Ally Lewber</strong> on Instagram on Tuesday, March 15, sharing loved-up photos of the two on a trip to Tulum, Mexico.</p><p>“Only the most magical trip I’ve ever experienced in my entire life, here’s a little slide show of todays adventure…. Share the love people! and the positivity! cause life’s too short,” the reality TV personality, 30, wrote in his caption.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/James-Kenedy-New-Girlfriend-Tulum.jpg><p>The <a href=#>former Sur busser</a> met his now-girlfriend in January after deejaying a concert for costar <a href=#><strong>Tom Sandoval</strong></a>’s cover band, The Most Extras, in Agoura Hills, California.</p><p>“She was with her friends that were fans,” he told costar <a href=#><strong>Lala Kent</strong></a> on her “Give Them Lala” podcast in February.</p><p>James did not tag Ally in the photos he posted, but he did not shy away from showing her off.</p><p>“James met Ally recently, and they have been dating for a few months now,” his rep told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>. “He’s super happy and excited to see what the future holds.”</p><p>According to her LinkedIn, Ally is an entertainment journalist and front desk receptionist at Soho House in West Hollywood.

I do like this girl, I really do,” he said. “I don’t know. We’ll see what happens. I can’t ask any girl to do that. With [Ally], I’m taking my time. She gets to really choose what she wants to do with that whole situation, and then for me, it’s like, I have to decide as well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTqKycoKeasqy42GeaqKVfpby0wNJooZqllah6rLHNp5ydsaNiu6bDjKCgq6SWp7amusNmmKWkqWK5psPBnqlmop%2BXerG0zq2mrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
