When it comes to someone like Moat you don't want your decision to embody that character to in any way be viewed as an endorsement of his behaviour. You have to have empathy as an actor but you don't want to be seen as sympathetic to him."</p><p id=eDDQtCrnJZm data-wc=19>Matt previously played Alex in the Channel 4 series Misfits, and he's also starred in Jamestown, Bodyguard and Cursed.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr>Vineeta Rishi&nbsp;</h2><p id=ezqvjyL_1S9 data-wc=37>"My character is based on two or three different police officers," Vineeta Rishi said.
