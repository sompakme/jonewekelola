We won't show it here out of respect for the awesome dev.</p><p><strong>30 October 2023: Marvel's Wolverine takes place in same universe as Spider-Man</strong></p><p>It has been confirmed that Marvel's Wolverine will take place in the same universe as the Marvel's Spider-Man games, namely Earth-1048.</p><p><strong>5 October 2023: Checked for any Marvel's Wolverine news or leaks</strong></p><p>We checked but couldn't find any new info on Marvel's Wolverine this time around. The search continues.</p><p><strong>5 January 2023: More Marvel's Wolverine news and details to come in 2023?</strong></p><p>We expect a lot more Marvel's Wolverine details to emerge throughout the year and will keep you updated on all leaks, news and details along the way.</p><p><strong>8 December: Watch The Game Awards 2022 live!</strong></p><p>We can't help but wonder if Marvel's Wolverine will show up at The Game Awards 2022. We aren't holding our breaths, as it is doubtful.</p><p>Tune in the watch The Game Awards 2022 via the YouTube stream embedded below. It kicks off on 8 December at 7:30 PM ET / 4:30 PM PT and 9 December at 00:30 GMT.</p><p></p><p>1 December 2022 - Marvel's Wolverine is rumored to release in 2024 at the earliest.</p><p>Industry insider Tom Henderson has said that Marvel's Wolverine is still a long way off, noting a release window of "2024 earliest," so the game could likely only release in 2025.</p><h2 id=mcetoc_1h2arsupb5><strong>When Will Marvel’s Wolverine Release?</strong></h2><p><strong>At the time of writing, there is no official confirmed release date for Marvel's Wolverine, but in this article, you’ll find all (if any) information that the developer shared, as well as some speculation from Ginx on when we could see it launch.</strong></p><p>When it was first announced in 2021, Insomniac Games stated it was in "very early development."</p><p>As a result, we doubt we'll see the game until late 2023 if we're being very optimistic. And considering that Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is set to arrive in 2023, this could potentially delay Marvel's Wolverine further into 2024.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/esjGgEUiFCl9olQINZgInh92uQqPBEEKpQejEeC4pYM/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9NYXJ2ZWwvTWFydmVsX3NfV29sdmVyaW5lXy1fUmVsZWFzZV9EYXRlJTJDX0xlYWtzJTJDX1RyYWlsZXIlMkNfYW5kX01vcmUvTWFydmVsX3NfV29sdmVyaW5lXy1fUmVsZWFzZV9EYXRlJTJDX0xlYWtzJTJDX1RyYWlsZXIlMkNfYW5kX01vcmVfcmVsZWFzZV9kYXRlLmpwZw><p>This leads us to conclude that Marvel's Wolverine is still a long way off, and we wouldn't get too excited for a release date any time soon. And based on what we know, the game will likely be in development for the next two years.</p><p>A leaked Microsoft CMA document did suggest that <a href=#>the game could release in 2023</a> but take this information with a grain of salt.</p><p>Regarding the platforms you can expect the game on once it releases, it's safe to assume that it is only being developed for next-generation consoles and will not be a cross-platform title.</p><p>This has been cemented more when considering a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">tweet from Insomniac Games</a> where they state that it will be released "exclusively" on the PlayStation 5.</p><h2 id=mcetoc_1h2arsupb6><strong>Marvel’s Wolverine - Trailer</strong></h2><p>Our first look at Marvel's Wolverine was a trailer showcased at Sony's PlayStation Showcase event in September 2021. The trailer, sadly, contains no actual gameplay and is merely a teaser trailer to set the scene of what we can expect from Logan's story in this new game.</p><p>Based on the brief trailer, the game appears to have a more bloody and mature tone than Insomniac Games' Marvel's Spider-Man title, which is fitting since the character has always had a bloody past and is far from a passive problem solver. You can check out the trailer below to get fresh eyes on what to expect.</p><p></p><h2 id=mcetoc_1h2arsupb7><strong>Marvel’s Wolverine - Leaks & News</strong></h2><p>Although there haven't been any official leaks regarding Marvel Wolverine, we see a few subtle easter eggs that might allude to what we can expect from the game. But it should be noted that the developers haven't confirmed these, so take all this information with a grain of salt.</p><p>Based on fan speculation, everything from references to the Hulk, the island of Madripoor, and a possible connection to Marvel's Spider-Man could place this game in the same connected universe. This would make sense since these two characters have shared panels with tons of other characters in the original comics.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/NY9CSCvZk2jynLBf4N0nnKi0CwOkZ1d47ineiDanwb0/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9NYXJ2ZWwvTWFydmVsX3NfV29sdmVyaW5lXy1fUmVsZWFzZV9EYXRlJTJDX0xlYWtzJTJDX1RyYWlsZXIlMkNfYW5kX01vcmUvTWFydmVsX3NfV29sdmVyaW5lXy1fUmVsZWFzZV9EYXRlJTJDX0xlYWtzJTJDX1RyYWlsZXIlMkNfYW5kX01vcmVfbGVha3MuanBn><p>There are numerous hidden clues to discover, and if you want to know more, check out <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">this YouTube video</a> that covers all of these possible easter eggs in more depth.</p><p>For now, that's everything we know regarding Marvel's Wolverine.
