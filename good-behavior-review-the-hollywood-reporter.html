Based on a collection of novellas by author Blake Crouch (Wayward Pines, Dark Matter), focusing on the character of <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=3>Letty</span> <span data-scayt_word=Dobesh data-scaytid=4>Dobesh</span> (Dockery), Good Behavior kicks off as maybe the best drama pilot TNT has produced since Southland, while Dockery’s new direction as a bad girl is wonderfully realized — and a very welcome relief for anyone tired of the reserved Lady Mary.</p><p><span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=5>Letty</span> is not a lady. She’s just out of prison. She’s a thief and a junkie and appears to be a functioning alcoholic. She dropped out of high school in the <span data-scayt_word=10th data-scaytid=7>10<span data-scayt_word=th data-scaytid=78>th</span></span> grade as her life started going sideways, but she’s by no means dumb. She’s wily and street-smart, with no real interest in working hard at anything. She’s got a young son from what was either a one-night stand or very brief relationship, since the father is out of the picture and hasn’t seen her in years.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p><span data-scayt_word="Letty's" data-scaytid=13>Letty’s</span> also got a mean-ass mother, Estelle (<span data-scayt_word=Lusia data-scaytid=15>Lusia</span> <span data-scayt_word=Strus data-scaytid=16>Strus</span>), who had <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=10>Letty</span> as a teenager, gave her little or no guidance and is trying to make some kind of amends by watching over <span data-scayt_word="Letty's" data-scaytid=14>Letty’s</span> son. But she’s refusing to let her junkie ex-con daughter anywhere near the boy no matter the emotional toll on <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=11>Letty</span>, which is a huge trigger.</p><p>Into this mess comes Javier (Juan Diego <span data-scayt_word=Botto data-scaytid=22>Botto</span>), an Argentine assassin. Or, more accurately, <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=19>Letty</span> and her mess of a life come into Javier’s quite by accident, as <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=20>Letty</span> has very successfully returned to her pre-prison life of using her great looks and effortless guile to rob people at high-end hotels. Pushing her luck, as always, <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=21>Letty</span> is snatching up money, clothes and booze from several rooms when she doesn’t get out of Javier’s in time, then overhears from the closet his discussion with a husband about their arrangement to have Javier kill the man’s wife.</p><p>This is where Good Behavior finds its dramatic crux, since <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=26>Letty</span> — after stealing the $50,000 Javier was paid upfront for the killing — decides that her particular moral compass can rationalize theft but not murder, so she goes to warn the wife before Javier kills her.</p><p>As expected, things go badly. And they continue to as Javier realizes that <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=28>Letty</span> and her well-tuned con game can help him on his next job as well. The question that comes up in the third episode (the series will smartly premiere with the first two episodes), is why Javier would want to keep <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=29>Letty</span> around since she doesn’t want any part of his assassin’s life and does enough to muck it up where it’s clear Javier would be better off without her.</p><p>There’s not really a series if these two part ways and a complicated one if they stay together. The early hook is that they share an extreme mutual sexual attraction and that plays out with more than a hint of masochism. But <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=32>Letty</span> pretty clearly explains that the two won’t have sex after the last time crosses a line. And yet, perhaps that won’t be true going forward in future episodes. Perhaps <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=33>Letty</span> likes it a little kinky. There’s an attempt in the third episode — though not a very convincing one — to prove maybe these two actually care for each other.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>And that’s really the issue facing Good Behavior — it only works if <span data-scayt_word="Letty's" data-scaytid=37>Letty’s</span> bad behavior gets a lot worse and she subjects herself to Javier. That might be the darker tone TNT is leaning toward and could make Good Behavior more compelling as it leans into that rougher corner. But it also remains to be seen if <span data-scayt_word=Botto data-scaytid=40>Botto</span>, a relatively unknown actor in America, has the chops (and is given the material) to make something dangerously deeper of Javier.</p><p>As in Fox’s event series Wayward Pines, Crouch is again helped out by executive producer and writer Chad Hodge (The Playboy Club). But if you worried how Wayward Pines functioned after an intriguing start, you might have the same concerns here over this series’ sustainability.</p><p>But Good Behavior is definitely worth a few more episodes to find out, despite a couple of keen flaws in the Javier character, who doesn’t appear to be nearly as deadly as we’re meant to believe. And a key scene in the second episode supposes that very public places don’t have cameras or, for example, people who could be looking out windows, which paints Javier as less than savvy about how not to get caught.</p><p>But on the plus side there’s Dockery’s magnetic performance, a thorough busting out of the Lady Mary shackles into a sexier, harder and more externally challenging (and interesting) character. The series also features the excellent character actor Terry Kinney (Billions, Show Me a Hero, Fargo) as <span data-scayt_word="Letty's" data-scaytid=42>Letty’s</span> parole officer, Christian. We get just enough of Christian to see he might be an intriguing addition to the mix. Likewise <span data-scayt_word=Strus data-scaytid=44>Strus</span> as <span data-scayt_word="Letty's" data-scaytid=43>Letty’s</span> mother.</p><p>But more than anything, Good Behavior‘s pivotal fourth episode will need to address how <span data-scayt_word=Letty data-scaytid=48>Letty</span> and Javier stay together and why — and it can’t take place in a car with a fading battery. If there’s a convincing way to keep these two connected, Good Behavior could really be something for TNT.</p><p>Cast: Michelle Dockery, Juan Diego <span data-scayt_word=Botto data-scaytid=50>Botto</span>, <span data-scayt_word=Lusia data-scaytid=51>Lusia</span> <span data-scayt_word=Strus data-scaytid=52>Strus</span>, Terry Kinney<br>Created and written by: Blake Crouch, Chad Hodge<br>Directed by: Charlotte <span data-scayt_word=Sieling data-scaytid=56>Sieling</span><br>Premieres: Tuesday, 9 p.m. ET/PT (TNT)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaeyt7XEsKpon5%2BksW6uxKGYr6Gfp3qzsdWinLBlaWmBeHyPaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
