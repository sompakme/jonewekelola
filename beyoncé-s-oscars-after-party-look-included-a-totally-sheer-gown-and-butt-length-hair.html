Bey showed off her jaw-dropping dress, designed by <a href=#>Celia Kritharioti</a>, which was made of totally see-through mesh fabric with strategically placed beading. The underboob- and butt-baring gown had one sleeve and the highest leg slit, ever, that went all the way up past her hip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She accessorized with a blingy <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Tiffany & Co.</a> diamond choker that looked as if it could've been a part of the dress, as well as stud earrings, a silver sparkly clutch, matching PVC heels, and thin metal sunglasses. She wore her hair in long, bouncy curls that reached the bottom of her back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the first image, the Destiny's Child alum held up a bedazzled sheer veil in front of her that also hung off her head in later slides. Several close-up snaps showed the dress' intricate detailing, while the carousel's last photo caught Beyoncé from behind as she looked over her shoulder. There was also a GIF of Jay Z with his arm around her as she through up peace and OK signs. Like many of the artist's posts, this one was also without a caption.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The hip-hop couple's after-party sparked a lot of backlash. The husband-and-wife duo held the soirée at the historic Los Angeles landmark hotel Chateau Marmont, which has recently come under fire due to allegations of employee mistreatment, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a>. Despite a workers' boycott, the industry's biggest names still turned out for the event.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8GesKimk5p6rLrOsKOeq1%2BXsrq7zZycZqejmK6zv4yana2domK9or7TsmSsoJWav26zzrClZpqlqcFuuMSnnq2gXZ2uqr4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
