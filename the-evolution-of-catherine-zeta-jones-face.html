Ironically, one of her biggest career triumphs came from embracing her beauty and her musical theater roots, something she had tried for years to escape. She shared with&nbsp;The Telegraph, "In my career, there has always been a kind of beauty aspect to it. I was pigeonholed for so many years being a musical comedy actress. I always wanted to be cast in one of Helena Bonham Carter's roles in those period dramas, I dreamed of that, but it never really came my way."</p><p>In the film, Zeta-Jones rocks a Louise Brooks-inspired flapper bob, which curiously enough, she had to fight for. On "<a href=#>The Drew Barrymore Show</a>," Zeta-Jones revealed that she battled with producers over Velma's haircut. The blunt style was part of her vision for the character. As she accurately noted, "They didn't have beach waves, you know, in 1930s Chicago." As Velma, Zeta-Jones painted her face with dramatic eye makeup and sultry lips. Makeup artist Cindy J. Williams shared on her <a href=#>Instagram</a> that while in character, Zeta-Jones wore Red Lizard lipstick by Nars and Contrast eye shadow by MAC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxgbIF1gI6eraikpam2sLqMnJitoJWntq%2BxjLOcrZldn7yvsdJmnZqblWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
