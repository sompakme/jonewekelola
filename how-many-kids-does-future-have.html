His most famous ex is <a href=#>the singer Ciara</a>; they <a href=#>share one son</a>, Future Wilburn Jr., <a href=#>born in 2014</a>.</p><p>Future had his first child, <a href=#>Jakobi Wilburn</a>, with a woman named Jessica Smith in 2002. His second child, <a href=#>Londyn Wilburn</a>, was born in 2009 to ex India J. The rapper had his third child, Prince Wilburn, with <a href=#>Brittni Mealy</a> in 2012. Then, after splitting up with Ciara, he had a son, Hendrix Wilburn, with then-girlfriend Joie Chavis, in 2018 (via <a href=#>USA Today</a>).</p><p>That brings the total to five children so far. Per <a href=#>The Blast</a>, Future seemingly confirmed that he only has children with five women in an Instagram Story in 2019, writing: "I have 5 wives BTW. Love them all to death."</p><p>However, rumors held that Future also had a sixth child named Kash with an anonymous woman in Arizona, born in 2014 or early 2015, per <a href=#>Ace Show Biz</a>. Future later confirmed Kash's existence with a <a href=#>tweet</a> in honor of Kash's mother for Mother's Day 2020.</p><p>Notably, Future also <a href=#>tweeted</a> about another child named Paris, whose mother he didn't mention by name. According to <a href=#>Vulture</a>, it's not&nbsp;totally clear if Future was revealing a seventh child with the tweet. However, he did&nbsp;shout out Paris in the midst of tweets about all his other kids, so we're going to count that as a confirmed child.</p><p>That's seven&nbsp;kids so far. But wait, it gets even more complicated!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2xjbX90e8eormalkaPGbrfInapmnJ%2BawG6y1K2sq51dna63sY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
