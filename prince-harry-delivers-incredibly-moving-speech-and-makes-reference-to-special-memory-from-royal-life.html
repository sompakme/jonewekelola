"Some of you may know what bagpipes mean to me, so I couldn't help but hope they'd be played!" he said in the speech.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Prince Harry references past royal life</figure><p id=euukZIqgru data-wc=89>Bagpipes were a favourite instrument of <a class=hm-link href=#>the late Queen</a>, Harry's grandmother, with the Duke sharing in his memoir, , that she loved to be awoken to the sound of the instrument, and that it should also play as she settled in for dinner. <a class=hm-link href=#>King Charles</a> is also awoken to the sound of bagpipes when he stays in his royal residences. Last October, a month after the late Queen's death, Charles shared a moving video of his piper playing for him for the first at his royal residence in London.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8bfe5796d5f9-prince-harry-emotional.jpg><p id=eOqi0Jv6GY data-wc=76>Harry went on to say that the instrument had a particularly poignant connection for the Master Corporal, as he shared: "Little did I know that thirty minutes later, it would be James picking them up and offering to play - yet I had NO idea what they meant to him. Nor did I know what memories they triggered for him. In Afghanistan he played 63 ramp ceremonies. For 63 caskets. For 63 souls. For 63 families.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/289be7905142-prince-harry-wave-stage.jpg><p id=e3y1xzLaEq data-wc=43>"For four years after that last ceremony, he couldn't touch them. This week he wasn't sure whether he could bring himself to PLAY them. But he did.
