At the time of her death, her manager said that she was taking <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>prescription drugs</a> for anxiety and sleep deprivation.</p><p>A drug-related death was rumored when news first broke given Laurer’s visible struggles with substance abuse, which were never more public than when she appeared on the first season of VH1’s <i>Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew</i> in 2008.</p><p>Hers is the latest in a long line of premature <i>Dr. Drew</i> alumni deaths, one that boosts the reality show’s now-infamous <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>mortality rate</a> even higher.</p><p>In 2013, Dr. Drew Pinsky, longtime host of the call-in radio program <i>Loveline</i>, <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>announced</a> that <i>Celebrity Rehab</i> would end after former cast member and country music singer Mindy McCready committed suicide.</p><p>“I’m tired. It’s very stressful and intense for me,” Pinsky said. “To have people questioning my motives and taking aim at me because people get sick and die because they have a life-threatening disease, and I take the blame?”</p><p>McCready was the <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>fifth celebrity</a> who appeared on Pinsky’s Pasadena-based addiction recovery show to die while it was still on the air. Up to that point, Rodney King, <i>Grease </i>star Jeff Conaway, Alice in Chains bassist Mike Starr, and The Real World cast member Joey Kovar had all passed away, some of them from problems related to those that they had gone on <i>Celebrity Rehab</i> to treat.</p><p>Conaway was treated for alcohol and drug addiction in the first two seasons, dying of pneumonia and encephalopathy three years later after an <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>overdose</a>. Starr, featured in Season Three, died from a <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>prescription drug overdose</a>, as Dr. Drew later acknowledged. King drowned in a swimming pool with <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>cocaine, PCP, marijuana, and alcohol</a> in his system. Kovar died of “<a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>opiate intoxication</a>.”</p><p>As calculated by <i>The Fix</i>, that gave the show an alarming death rate approaching <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>13 percent</a> of its cast members, sparking conversation about a <i>Celebrity Rehab </i>“<a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>curse</a>” and placing further scrutiny on the show’s questionable treatment techniques.</p><p>Deaths of <i>Dr. Drew </i>alumni are to be expected. Relapse rates for drug addiction range from <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>40 to 60 percent</a> according to a 2000 study in the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. But as critics like <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Tracie Egan Morrissey</a> observed, practicing therapy on high-profile public individuals in front of cameras may not have been the most effective form of treatment.</p><p>While his now-deceased bandmate was still on the show, Alice in Chains drummer Sean Kinney <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>called</a> the show “pretty disgusting,” saying, “I don’t think it helps anybody and it makes entertainment out of people’s possible death, and that’s pathetic and it’s stupid.”</p><p>In her own appearance on the show’s first season, Chyna was reluctant to discuss her own substance abuse onscreen.</p><p>“What scares you the most about being here?” an employee of the Pasadena rehab center <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>asked</a> her in an early episode.</p><p>“I think what scares me most about being here is the confusion of why I’m here,” she replied, evading the question. “I haven’t decided for myself what the issue is.”</p><p>By <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>Episode Five</a>, she was more forthright but still did not directly address drugs or alcohol. In a group meeting, counselor Bob Forrest told her directly, “Your misery is caused by drugs and alcohol but you can’t see it, so it really doesn’t matter what everybody else sees.”</p><p>“Frankly, I’m tired of saying the things that I have done and being accused of everything else,” Chyna responded, after Forrest and Pinsky pressed about which substances she used.</p><p>“I just feel like I lived in a hell forever,” she acknowledged, but continued to deflect specific questions.</p><p>Her struggles persisted after leaving the show. In 2010, the sports icon was reportedly hospitalized in Los Angeles for <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>overdosing</a> on sleeping medication.</p><p>Pinsky would go on to defend his show, and its track record of untimely deaths, telling <a class="LinkWrapper LinkWrapper--external" href=#>CNN</a>, “If I was doing a show on cancer there would not be much surprise when my cancer patient died. In fact, we’d celebrate a few years of good quality life. People don’t understand that addiction has virtually the same prognosis.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnZiipKmXsqK%2F02eaqKVflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmV%2Bd3uPbWZral%2BptaZ5y5qqrWWUlsa0ec6fZLCvlWLAbq%2FHsqWaZZGjsW7Ax55krqailsOmuMinnmanlmKxs3nDq5ywZaNisKa4xJupoqypYq6twcynoA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
