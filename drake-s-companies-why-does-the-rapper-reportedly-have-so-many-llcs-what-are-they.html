And like any serious entrepreneur, Drake protects his assets and investments by strategically forming multiple companies. Over the years, he has been incorporating new businesses left and right, with CBC Canada reports showing he's racked up over 50 different companies and LLCs to his name. It's undoubtedly a head-spinning amount of corporate entities for one guy, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">this has brought backlash his way</a>. After all, for Drake, these companies are all part of the meticulous strategy to grow and maintain his empire.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">See, an LLC (limited liability company) is a type of business structure that protects an owner's personal wealth from the potential risks of any single business failing or facing lawsuits. By separating different ventures into their own LLCs, Drake ringfences each project. Therefore, if one goes belly-up, it can't threaten to bankrupt his whole operation. It's genius asset protection 101 for ballers of his net worth, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">which Forbes estimates around $250 million</a>. So what are some of Drake's key companies and LLCs? Let's break it down.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ovo-sound>OVO Sound</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This is Drake's record label, co-founded in 2012 with Noah "40" Shebib and Oliver El-Khatib. Previously a subsidiary of Warner Records, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">OVO Sound</a> became an independent label in 2022. It has since launched the careers of artists like <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>PartyNextDoor</a>, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Majid Jordan</a>, and Drake's longtime collaborator, dvsn. Today, OVO Sound is a household name within the music industry.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ovo-clothing>OVO Clothing</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Another one of Drake’s most popular companies is OVO Clothing. This is his signature streetwear line featuring that iconic owl logo you’ve probably seen a couple of times. OVO apparel quickly became a fashion statement, collaborating with heavy hitters like Canada Goose on premium outerwear pieces. Drizzy even has an entire sub-label with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Nike</a> called Nocta. With separate LLCs for OVO Clothing, Nocta, and likely other OVO brand extensions, Drake maximizes that hot branding across product lines and companies.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-dreamcrew-entertainment>DreamCrew Entertainment</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Drake's multi-faceted production company was co-founded with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> the Prince in 2017. DreamCrew has scored major hits producing shows like Netflix's Top Boy and HBO's teen drama Euphoria. His commitment to entertainment at large has made Drake a lowkey, yet successful producer.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-just-won-t-stop>Drake Just Won’t Stop</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Within Drake's array of companies are dozens of individual LLCs covering various aspects of his business interests. These include: at least 9 LLCs with the "DreamCrew" name for his production ventures, and 18 LLCs starting with his initials "ADG" (Aubrey Drake Graham). Moreover, there are other LLCs like "Owl Creative Holdings" tied to his OVO brand. Finally, there are cryptic names like "Silence Policy LLC," and "Strix S-Corp."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The LLC corporate structure allows Drake to separate different assets and business activities in his companies. As a result, any risks related to that project are isolated to that particular project and the assets of that particular entity. Moreover, in addition to his core businesses, Drake has used LLCs to make strategic investments across other sectors. These include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The plant-based food company Daring Foods</li><li>The Crypto payment platform MoonPay</li><li>Italian soccer club AC Milan (partnering with LeBron James)</li><li>Esports/lifestyle brand 100 Thieves</li><li>Real estate holdings like his $100 million Toronto mansion</li></ul><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-conclusion-nbsp>Conclusion&nbsp;</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Evidently, Drake is a man who is playing multi-dimensional business chess with these companies. For a business mogul of his stature, forming new companies regularly is just smart asset management. Altogether, Drake is playing the business game at an elite level. He is using the same tactics as billionaires like Donald Trump to amass a fortune. Just as he's rapped, Drake indeed aims to "turn into Jay" by building an empire that goes far beyond his musical artistry. His multitude of LLCs are the behind-the-scenes legal entities that will help grow and protect that empire for years to come.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Demilade Phillips has been a Features Writer for HotNewHipHop since 2023.
