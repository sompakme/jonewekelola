Because of this, it is advised that non-detergent oil be used in pressure cleaner pumping systems. If you put detergent oil in a pump, all of the contaminates that it removes from the surfaces will be forced into the oil as the oil circulates. This increases the likelihood of wear occurring inside the pump.</p><p></p><h3>What is the best way to drain oil from a pressure washer?</h3><p>Remove the engine’s oil and gasoline and set them aside.
