A national fixture for decades, Linkletter at one point had five shows running concurrently on network TV. Died May 26 at his Bel Air home at age 97.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2>Arthur Penn, director</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/arthur_penn_2010_a_p.jpg><p>His films often flew in the face of American mythology, no more so than the polarizing Bonnie and Clyde. A product of the golden era of live television and an accomplished theater director, Penn’s work on The Miracle Worker earned him an Emmy nomination in 1957, a Tony in 1959 and an Oscar nom in 1962. At one time, Penn had five hits running simultaneously on Broadway.

His often controversial career spanned six decades, beginning as one of Edward R. Murrow’s recruits at CBS. Schorr joined CNN in 1979, becoming the nucleus of the fledgling cable outfit’s foray into round-the-clock news, and since 1985 he served as an analyst at NPR.

His casting was a bit of a fluke; Walt Disney was screening the sci-fi movie Them! and looking at James Arness for the role, but Parker, in a bit role as a man frightened by an alien encounter, caught Disney's eye. Parker, while studying drama at the University of Texas, was discovered by actor Adolphe Menjou.&nbsp; Died March 17, 2010 of natural causes at his home in California's Santa Ynez Valley at age 85.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2>Gloria Stuart, actress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/gloria_stuart_2010_a_p.jpg><p>The leading lady of the 1930s enjoyed a career revival for her Oscar-nominated performance as Old Rose in 1997's Titanic.
