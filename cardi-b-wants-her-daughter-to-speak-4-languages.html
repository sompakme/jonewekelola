Sorry, Kultured.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In her People en Españolcover story, the rapper reveals that she wants 3-month-old daughter Kulture Kiari Cephus "to speak four languages: Spanish, English, French and I’m really loving Italian. I love how those people talk!”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cardi herself is multilingual, speaking Spanish, English as well as a smidgen of Russian and French. While her first language is Spanish (she grew up with a Dominican father and Trinidadian mother) and her second English, she told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Fader</a> earlier this year that she adopted a few Russian phrases while working in her first strip club with Russian women; she also picked up a bit of French here and there. However, because she doesn't regularly associate with Russian or French speakers, she's not fluent in either.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In past interviews, the 26-year-old has also revealed that she's insecure about her "broken English."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don’t got the best English in the world, so sometimes I really got to ask somebody, ‘Does this make sense? Would this make sense?’ Because I will probably use the words … that they don’t even supposed to go there,” she told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GQ</a> in April.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that at times, her trouble with pronunciation has even held up her work. "That’s my biggest problem, that takes me a long time in the booth ... I be trying to pronounce words properly and without an accent. Each and every song from my album, I most likely did it over five times, because I’m really insecure about my accent when it comes to music. In person, I don’t care.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though she may find it a bother, Cardi B's idiosyncratic speaking style has become part of her signature charm. When it comes to learning to speak up for herself — in English or otherwise — Kulture's definitely in good hands.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeTlr%2BltYybZKStnKnCs7GMpZinn6WWtKa%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
